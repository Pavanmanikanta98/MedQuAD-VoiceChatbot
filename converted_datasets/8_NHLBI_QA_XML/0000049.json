                    "Answer": "Cystic fibrosis (SIS-tik fi-BRO-sis), or CF, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-KREH-tor-ee) glands. Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat.\n                \n\"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the diseaseone from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves.\n                \nCF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected.\n                \nIf you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.)\n                \nThe buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs.\n                \nThe thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine.\n                \nThese enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort.\n                \nCF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\n                \nIf you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh).\n                \nCF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.)\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years.\n                \nThe symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often.\n                \nLung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF.\n                \nAs treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer.\n                \nEarly treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems."

                    "Answer": "A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat.\n                \nResearch suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF.\n                \nMore than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease.\n                \nHow Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited?\n                \nEvery person inherits two CFTR genesone from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF.\n                \nChildren who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children.\n                \nThe image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children.\n                \nExample of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis"

However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent.\n                \nCF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans.\n                \nMore than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers."

                    "Answer": "The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe.\n                \nOne of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born.\n                \nMost of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body.\n                \nCystic Fibrosis\n                \n\n                \nRespiratory System Signs and Symptoms\n                \nPeople who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody.\n                \nPeople who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF.\n                \nPeople who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage.\n                \nAs CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis).\n                \nSome people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery.\n                \nDigestive System Signs and Symptoms\n                \nIn CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines.\n                \nAs a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort.\n                \nA hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins.\n                \nAs CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as:\n                \nPancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain.\n                \nRectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum.\n                \nLiver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts.\n                \nDiabetes.\n                \nGallstones.\n                \nReproductive System Signs and Symptoms\n                \nMen who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis.\n                \nWomen who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications.\n                \nOther Signs, Symptoms, and Complications\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood.\n                \nCF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\n                \nCF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n                \nLow bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia."

                    "Answer": "Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests.\n                \nNewborn Screening\n                \nAll States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly.\n                \nSweat Test\n                \nIf a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat.\n                \nFor this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling.\n                \nSweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nIf you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as:\n                \nGenetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF.\n                \nA chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air.\n                \nA sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF.\n                \nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\n                \nA sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment.\n                \nPrenatal Screening\n                \nIf you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS).\n                \nIn amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal.\n                \nIn CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF.\n                \nCystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing\n                \nPeople who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children.\n                \nIf you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier.\n                \nA genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases."

                    "Answer": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include:\n                \nPreventing and controlling lung infections\n                \nLoosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs\n                \nPreventing or treating blockages in the intestines\n                \nProviding enough nutrition\n                \nPreventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body)\n                \nDepending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF.\n                \nOften, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers.\n                \nThe United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics.\n                \nFor more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page.\n                \nTreatment for Lung Problems\n                \nThe main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.\n                \nChest Physical Therapy\n                \nCPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.\n                \nYou might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\n                \nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\n                \nA mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.\n                \nBreathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.\n                \nExercise\n                \nAerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.\n                \nHowever, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood.\n                \nIf you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older).\n                \nAntibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nOral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital.\n                \nAnti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.\n                \nBronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms.\n                \nTreatments for Advanced Lung Disease\n                \nIf you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask.\n                \nIf other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.\n                \nPulmonary Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\n                \nPR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:\n                \nExercise training\n                \nNutritional counseling\n                \nEducation on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it\n                \nEnergy-conserving techniques\n                \nBreathing strategies\n                \nPsychological counseling and/or group support\n                \nPR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article.\n                \nTreatment for Digestive Problems\n                \nCF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort.
