                    "Answer": "Hypotension (HI-po-TEN-shun) is abnormally low blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood.\n                \nBlood pressure is measured as systolic (sis-TOL-ik) and diastolic (di-a-STOL-ik) pressures. \"Systolic\" refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. \"Diastolic\" refers to blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.\n                \nYou most often will see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic number, such as 120/80 mmHg. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nNormal blood pressure in adults is lower than 120/80 mmHg. Hypotension is blood pressure that's lower than 90/60 mmHg.\n                \nOverview\n                \nBlood pressure doesn't stay the same all the time. It lowers as you sleep and rises when you wake up. Blood pressure also rises when you're excited, nervous, or active.\n                \nYour body is very sensitive to changes in blood pressure. For example, if you stand up quickly, your blood pressure may drop for a short time. Your body adjusts your blood pressure to make sure enough blood and oxygen are flowing to your brain, kidneys, and other vital organs.\n                \nMost forms of hypotension happen because your body can't bring blood pressure back to normal or can't do it fast enough.\n                \nSome people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no signs or symptoms, and their low blood pressure is normal for them.\n                \nIn other people, certain conditions or factors cause abnormally low blood pressure. As a result, less blood and oxygen flow to the body's organs.\n                \nFor the most part, hypotension is a medical concern only if it causes signs or symptoms or is linked to a serious condition, such as heart disease. Signs and symptoms of hypotension may include dizziness, fainting, cold and sweaty skin, fatigue (tiredness), blurred vision, or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).\n                \nIn extreme cases, hypotension can lead to shock.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIn a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment. If it causes signs or symptoms, your doctor will try to find and treat the condition that's causing it.\n                \nHypotension can be dangerous. It can make you fall because of dizziness or fainting. Shock, a severe form of hypotension, is a condition that's often fatal if not treated right away. With prompt and proper treatment, shock can be successfully treated."

                    "Answer": "Conditions or factors that disrupt the body's ability to control blood pressure cause hypotension. The different types of hypotension have different causes.\n                \nOrthostatic Hypotension\n                \nOrthostatic hypotension has many causes. Sometimes two or more factors combine to cause this type of low blood pressure.\n                \nDehydration (de-hi-DRA-shun) is the most common cause of orthostatic hypotension. Dehydration occurs if the body loses more water than it takes in.\n                \nYou may become dehydrated if you don't drink enough fluids or if you sweat a lot during physical activity. Fever, vomiting, and severe diarrhea also can cause dehydration.\n                \nOrthostatic hypotension also may occur during pregnancy, but it usually goes away after birth.\n                \nBecause an older body doesn't manage changes in blood pressure as well as a younger body, getting older also can lead to this type of hypotension.\n                \nPostprandial hypotension (a type of orthostatic hypotension) mostly affects older adults. Postprandial hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure after a meal.\n                \nCertain medical conditions can raise your risk of orthostatic hypotension, including:\n                \nHeart conditions, such as heart attack, heart valve disease, bradycardia (a very low heart rate), and heart failure. These conditions prevent the heart from pumping enough blood to the body.\n                \nAnemia.\n                \nSevere infections.\n                \nEndocrine conditions, such as thyroid disorders, Addison's disease, low blood sugar, and diabetes.\n                \nCentral nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.\n                \nPulmonary embolism.\n                \nSome medicines for high blood pressure and heart disease can raise your risk of orthostatic hypotension. These medicines include:\n                \nDiuretics, also called \"water pills\"\n                \nCalcium channel blockers\n                \nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n                \nAngiotensin II receptor blockers\n                \nNitrates\n                \nBeta blockers\n                \nMedicines for conditions such as anxiety, depression, erectile dysfunction, and central nervous system disorders also can increase your risk of orthostatic hypotension.\n                \nOther substances, when taken with high blood pressure medicines, also can lead to orthostatic hypotension. These substances include alcohol, barbiturates, and some prescription and over-the-counter medicines.\n                \nFinally, other factors or conditions that can trigger orthostatic hypotension include being out in the heat or being immobile for a long time. \"Immobile\" means you can't move around very much.\n                \nNeurally Mediated Hypotension\n                \nNeurally mediated hypotension (NMH) occurs when the brain and heart don't communicate with each other properly.\n                \nFor example, when you stand for a long time, blood begins to pool in your legs. This causes your blood pressure to drop. In NMH, the body mistakenly tells the brain that blood pressure is high. In response, the brain slows the heart rate. This makes blood pressure drop even more, causing dizziness and other symptoms.\n                \nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\n                \nMany factors and conditions can cause severe hypotension linked to shock. Some of these factors also can cause orthostatic hypotension. In shock, though, blood pressure drops very low and doesn't return to normal on its own.\n                \nShock is an emergency and must be treated right away. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911.\n                \nSome severe infections can cause shock. This is known as septic shock. It can occur if bacteria enter the bloodstream. The bacteria release a toxin (poison) that leads to a dangerous drop in blood pressure.\n                \nA severe loss of blood or fluids from the body also can cause shock. This is known as hypovolemic (HI-po-vo-LE-mik) shock. Hypovolemic shock can happen as a result of:\n                \nMajor external bleeding (for example, from a severe cut or injury)\n                \nMajor internal bleeding (for example, from a ruptured blood vessel or injury that causes bleeding inside the body)\n                \nMajor loss of body fluids from severe burns\n                \nSevere swelling of the pancreas (an organ that produces enzymes and hormones, such as insulin)\n                \nSevere diarrhea\n                \nSevere kidney disease\n                \nOveruse of diuretics\n                \nA major decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood also can cause shock. This is known as cardiogenic (KAR-de-o-JEN-ik) shock.\n                \nA heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or an ongoing arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah) that disrupts heart function can cause this type of shock.\n                \nA sudden and extreme relaxation of the arteries linked to a drop in blood pressure also can cause shock. This is known as vasodilatory (VA-so-DI-la-tory) shock. It can occur due to:\n                \nA severe head injury\n                \nA reaction to certain medicines\n                \nLiver failure\n                \nPoisoning\n                \nA severe allergic reaction (called anaphylactic (AN-a-fi-LAK-tik) shock)"

They include:\n                \nDizziness or light-headedness\n                \nBlurry vision\n                \nConfusion\n                \nWeakness\n                \nFatigue (feeling tired)\n                \nNausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\n                \nOrthostatic hypotension may happen within a few seconds or minutes of standing up after you've been sitting or lying down.\n                \nYou may feel that you're going to faint, or you may actually faint. These signs and symptoms go away if you sit or lie down for a few minutes until your blood pressure adjusts to normal.\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of NMH occur after standing for a long time or in response to an unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situation. The drop in blood pressure with NMH doesn't last long and often goes away after sitting down.\n                \nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\n                \nIn shock, not enough blood and oxygen flow to the body's major organs, including the brain. The early signs and symptoms of reduced blood flow to the brain include light-headedness, sleepiness, and confusion.\n                \nIn the earliest stages of shock, it may be hard to detect any signs or symptoms. In older people, the first symptom may only be confusion.\n                \nOver time, as shock worsens, a person won't be able to sit up without passing out. If the shock continues, the person will lose consciousness. Shock often is fatal if not treated right away.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of shock vary, depending on what's causing the shock. When low blood volume (from major blood loss, for example) or poor pumping action in the heart (from heart failure, for example) causes shock:\n                \nThe skin becomes cold and sweaty. It often looks blue or pale. If pressed, the color returns to normal more slowly than usual. A bluish network of lines appears under the skin.\n                \nThe pulse becomes weak and rapid.\n                \nThe person begins to breathe very quickly.\n                \nWhen extreme relaxation of blood vessels causes shock (such as in vasodilatory shock), a person feels warm and flushed at first. Later, the skin becomes cold and sweaty, and the person feels very sleepy.\n                \nShock is an emergency and must be treated right away. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911."

                    },
                    "Answer": "Hypotension is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor will want to know:\n                \nThe type of hypotension you have and how severe it is\n                \nWhether an underlying condition is causing the hypotension\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nA primary care doctor or specialist may diagnose and treat hypotension. The type of specialist most commonly involved is a cardiologist (heart specialist).\n                \nOther specialists also may be involved, such as surgeons, nephrologists (kidney specialists), or neurologists (brain and nerve specialists).\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nShock is a life-threatening condition that requires emergency treatment. For other types of hypotension, your doctor may recommend tests to find out how your blood pressure responds in certain situations.\n                \nThe test results will help your doctor understand why you're fainting or having other symptoms.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nDuring a blood test, a small amount of blood is taken from your body. It's usually drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.\n                \nBlood tests can show whether anemia or low blood sugar is causing your hypotension.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG also shows the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nHolter and event monitors are medical devices that record your heart's electrical activity. These monitors are similar to an EKG. However, a standard EKG only records your heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect heart rhythm problems that don't occur during the test.\n                \nHolter and event monitors are small, portable devices. You can wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for longer periods than a standard EKG.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done as part of a stress test (see below). Stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease (also called coronary artery disease).\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done.\n                \nThese tests may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.\n                \nValsalva Maneuver\n                \nThis is a simple test for the part of your nervous system that controls functions such as your heartbeat and the narrowing and widening of your blood vessels. If something goes wrong with this part of the nervous system, blood pressure problems may occur.\n                \nDuring this test, you take a deep breath and then force the air out through your lips. You will do this several times. Your heart rate and blood pressure will be checked during the test.\n                \nTilt Table Test\n                \nThis test is used if you have fainting spells for no known reason. For the test, you lie on a table that moves from a lying down to an upright position. Your doctor checks your reaction to the change in position.\n                \nDoctors use a tilt table test to diagnose orthostatic hypotension and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH). People who have NMH usually faint during this test. The test can help your doctor find any underlying brain or nerve condition."

The goal of treatment is to bring blood pressure back to normal to relieve signs and symptoms. Another goal is to manage any underlying condition causing the hypotension.\n                \nYour response to treatment depends on your age, overall health, and strength. It also depends on how easily you can stop, start, or change medicines.\n                \nIn a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment.\n                \nIf you have signs or symptoms of hypotension, you should sit or lie down right away. Put your feet above the level of your heart. If your signs or symptoms don't go away quickly, you should seek medical care.\n                \nOrthostatic Hypotension\n                \nMany treatments are available for orthostatic hypotension. If you have this condition, your doctor may advise making lifestyle changes, such as:\n                \nDrinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.\n                \nDrinking little or no alcohol.\n                \nStanding up slowly.\n                \nNot crossing your legs while sitting.\n                \nSlowly increasing the amount of time you sit up if you've been immobile for a long time because of a medical condition. The term \"immobile\" refers to not being able to move around very much.\n                \nEating small, low-carbohydrate meals if you have postprandial hypotension (a form of orthostatic hypotension).\n                \nTalk with your doctor about using compression stockings. These stockings apply pressure to your lower legs. The pressure helps move blood throughout your body.\n                \nIf medicine is causing your low blood pressure, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take.\n                \nSeveral medicines are used to treat orthostatic hypotension. These medicines, which raise blood pressure, include fludrocortisone and midodrine.\n                \nNeurally Mediated Hypotension\n                \nIf you have neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), you may need to make lifestyle changes. These may include:\n                \nAvoiding situations that trigger symptoms, such as standing for long periods. Unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situations also can trigger symptoms.\n                \nDrinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.\n                \nIncreasing your salt intake (as your doctor advises).\n                \nLearning to recognize symptoms that occur before fainting and taking action to raise your blood pressure. For example, sitting down and putting your head between your knees or lying down can help raise blood pressure.\n                \nIf medicine is causing your hypotension, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. He or she also may prescribe medicine to treat NMH.\n                \nChildren who have NHM often outgrow it.\n                \nSevere Hypotension Linked to Shock\n                \nShock is a life-threatening emergency. People who have shock need prompt treatment from medical personnel.
