                    "Answer": "Pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), or PH, is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen.\n                \nPH causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity (for example, climbing two flights of stairs), tiredness, chest pain, and a racing heartbeat. As the condition worsens, its symptoms may limit all physical activity.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand PH, it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work. Your heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum.\n                \nEach side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber. The lower right chamber of your heart, the right ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries. The blood then travels to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen.\n                \nThe upper left chamber of your heart, the left atrium (AY-tree-um), receives the oxygen-rich blood from your lungs. The blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta.\n                \nFor more information about the heart and lungs, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works and How the Lungs Work articles.\n                \nPH begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if:\n                \nThe walls of the arteries tighten.\n                \nThe walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells.\n                \nBlood clots form in the arteries.\n                \nThese changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. As a result, the pressure in your arteries rises. Also, because your heart is working harder than normal, your right ventricle becomes strained and weak.\n                \nYour heart may become so weak that it can't pump enough blood to your lungs. This causes heart failure. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have PH.\n                \nPH is divided into five groups based on its causes. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 820 mmHg at rest. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nOther diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots, usually cause PH. Some people inherit the condition (that is, their parents pass the genes for PH on to them). In some cases, the cause isn't known.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPH has no cure. However, research for new treatments is ongoing. The earlier PH is treated, the easier it is to control.\n                \nTreatments include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. These treatments can relieve PH symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms."

                    },
                    "Answer": "Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nPH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms.\n                \nWhen symptoms do occur, they're often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH.\n                \nYour doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH.\n                \nTests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis\n                \nEchocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it's working.\n                \nChest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged.\n                \nThe pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries.\n                \nA chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that's causing or contributing to PH.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart's rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained.\n                \nRight heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart.\n                \nDuring this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart.\n                \nTests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nPH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause.\n                \nChest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH.\n                \nChest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH.\n                \nLung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH.\n                \nPolysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse.\n                \nA PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article.\n                \nLung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung's blood vessels.\n                \nBlood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis).\n                \nFinding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nExercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n                \nA 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle.\n                \nDuring exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4.\n                \nClass 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don't cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.\n                \nClass 2 has slight or mild limits. You're comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms.\n                \nClass 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You're comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms.\n                \nClass 4 has severe limits. You're not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest.\n                \nOver time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one."

                    "Answer": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.\n                \nPH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\")\n                \nGroup 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension\n                \nGroup 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.\n                \nExamples of medicines for group 1 PAH include:\n                \nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil\n                \nProstanoids, such as epoprostenol\n                \nEndothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan\n                \nCalcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization.\n                \nMedical and Surgical Procedures\n                \nIf you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures.\n                \nAtrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum.\n                \nA tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States.\n                \nLung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH.\n                \nHeartlung transplant. A heartlung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor.\n                \nGroup 2 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nConditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery.\n                \nGroup 3 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nLung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH.\n                \nIf you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease.\n                \nGroup 4 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nBlood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger.\n                \nSometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots.\n                \nGroup 5 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nVarious diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH.\n                \nGroup 5 PH is treated by treating its cause.\n                \nAll Types of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nSeveral treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include:\n                \nDiuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet.\n                \nBlood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger.\n                \nDigoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur.\n                \nOxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood.\n                \nPhysical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you.\n                \nResearch is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future."
