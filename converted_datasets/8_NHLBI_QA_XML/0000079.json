                    "Answer": "Immune thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-toe-PE-ne-ah), or ITP, is a bleeding disorder. In ITP, the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) or thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites).\n                \nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nOverview\n                \nWithout enough platelets, bleeding can occur inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding).\n                \nPeople who have ITP often have purple bruises called purpura (PURR-purr-ah). These bruises appear on the skin or mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). Bleeding from small blood vessels under the skin causes purpura.\n                \nPeople who have ITP also may have bleeding that causes tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\n                \nPetechiae and Purpura\n                \n\n                \nPeople who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums during dental work, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal.\n                \nA lot of bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump.\n                \nBleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs.\n                \nIn most cases, an autoimmune response is thought to cause ITP. Normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.\n                \nITP can't be passed from one person to another.\n                \nTypes of Immune Thrombocytopenia\n                \nThe two types of ITP are acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting).\n                \nAcute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in childrenboth boys and girlsand is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after a viral infection.\n                \nChronic ITP lasts 6 months or longer and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children do get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women two to three times more often than men.\n                \nTreatment depends on the severity of bleeding and the platelet count. In mild cases, treatment may not be needed.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nFor most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.\n                \nAcute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In 80 percent of children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 to 12 months. Treatment may not be needed.\n                \nFor a small number of children, ITP doesn't go away on its own and may require further medical or surgical treatment.\n                \nChronic ITP varies from person to person and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades. Most people who have chronic ITP can stop treatment at some point and maintain a safe platelet count."

Both children and adults can develop ITP.\n                \nChildren usually have the acute (short-term) type of ITP. Acute ITP often develops after a viral infection.\n                \nAdults tend to have the chronic (long-lasting) type of ITP. Women are two to three times more likely than men to develop chronic ITP.\n                \nThe number of cases of ITP is rising because routine blood tests that can detect a low platelet count are being done more often.\n                \nITP can't be passed from one person to another."

Bleeding under the skin causes petechiae.\n                \nA collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin that looks or feels like a lump.

This includes menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal. Bleeding in the brain is rare, and its symptoms may vary.\n                \nA low platelet count doesn't directly cause pain, problems concentrating, or other symptoms.

                    "Answer": "Your doctor will diagnose immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nYour doctor will want to make sure that your low platelet count isn't due to another condition (such as an infection) or medicines you're taking (such as chemotherapy medicines or aspirin).\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask about:\n                \nYour signs and symptoms of bleeding and any other signs or symptoms you're having\n                \nWhether you have illnesses that could lower your platelet count or cause bleeding\n                \nMedicines or any over-the-counter supplements or remedies you take that could cause bleeding or lower your platelet count\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring a physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of bleeding and infection. For example, your doctor may look for purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes and pinpoint red spots on the skin. These are signs of bleeding under the skin.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou'll likely have blood tests to check your platelet count. These tests usually include:\n                \nA complete blood count. This test checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. In ITP, the red and white blood cell counts are normal, but the platelet count is low.\n                \nA blood smear. For this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets and other blood cells.\n                \nYou also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies (proteins) that attack platelets.\n                \nIf blood tests show that your platelet count is low, your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example, bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is making enough platelets.\n                \nIf you're at risk for HIV, hepatitis C, or H. pylori, your doctor may screen you for these infections, which might be linked to ITP.\n                \nSome people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. They may be diagnosed only if a blood test done for another reason shows that they have low platelet counts."

                    "Answer": "Treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count.\n                \nAdults who have mild ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. Adults who have ITP with very low platelet counts or bleeding problems often are treated.\n                \nThe acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated.\n                \nChildren who have mild ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure their platelet counts return to normal.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedicines often are used as the first course of treatment for both children and adults.\n                \nCorticosteroids (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat ITP. These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count. However, steroids have many side effects. Some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends.\n                \nThe steroids used to treat ITP are different from the illegal steroids that some athletes take to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.\n                \nOther medicines also are used to raise the platelet count. Some are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include rituximab, immune globulin, and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin.\n                \nMedicines also may be used with a procedure to remove the spleen called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).\n                \nIf medicines or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicineseltrombopag and romiplostimcan be used to treat ITP.\n                \nRemoval of the Spleen (Splenectomy)\n                \nIf needed, doctors can surgically remove the spleen. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.\n                \nThe spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infections. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets by mistake.\n                \nIf ITP hasn't responded to medicines, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may raise your risk for infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent infections.\n                \nIf your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms to watch for.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nPlatelet Transfusions\n                \nSome people who have ITP with severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need platelet transfusions before having surgery.\n                \nFor a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.\n                \nFor more information about platelet transfusions, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.\n                \nTreating Infections\n                \nSome infections can briefly lower your platelet count. Treating the infection may help increase your platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.\n                \nStopping Medicines\n                \nSome medicines can lower your platelet count or cause bleeding. Stopping the medicine can sometimes help raise your platelet count or prevent bleeding.\n                \nFor example, aspirin and ibuprofen are common medicines that increase the risk of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines."

Examples of such medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen.\n                \nProtect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding.\n                \nSeek treatment right away if you develop any infections. Report any symptoms of infection, such as a fever, to your doctor. This is very important for people who have ITP and have had their spleens removed."
