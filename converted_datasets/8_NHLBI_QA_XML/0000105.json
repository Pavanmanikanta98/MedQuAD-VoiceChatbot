                    "Answer": "Pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germssuch as bacteria, viruses, and fungican cause pneumonia.\n                \nThe infection inflames your lungs' air sacs, which are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing.\n                \nOverview\n                \nPneumonia and its symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health.\n                \nPneumonia tends to be more serious for:\n                \nInfants and young children.\n                \nOlder adults (people 65 years or older).\n                \nPeople who have other health problems, such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n                \nPeople who have weak immune systems as a result of diseases or other factors. Examples of these diseases and factors include HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), and an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPneumonia is common in the United States. Treatment for pneumonia depends on its cause, how severe your symptoms are, and your age and overall health. Many people can be treated at home, often with oral antibiotics.\n                \nChildren usually start to feel better in 1 to 2 days. For adults, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. Anyone who has worsening symptoms should see a doctor.\n                \nPeople who have severe symptoms or underlying health problems may need treatment in a hospital. It may take 3 weeks or more before they can go back to their normal routines.\n                \nFatigue (tiredness) from pneumonia can last for a month or more."

                    "Answer": "Many germs can cause pneumonia. Examples include different kinds of bacteria, viruses, and, less often, fungi.\n                \nMost of the time, the body filters germs out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia (SIL-e-ah) help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. (For more information, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.)\n                \nSometimes, though, germs manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if:\n                \nYour immune system is weak\n                \nA germ is very strong\n                \nYour body fails to filter germs out of the air that you breathe\n                \nFor example, if you can't cough because you've had a stroke or are sedated, germs may remain in your airways. (\"Sedated\" means you're given medicine to make you sleepy.)\n                \nWhen germs reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the germs. These cells cause the alveoli (air sacs) to become red and inflamed and to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia.\n                \nGerms That Can Cause Pneumonia\n                \nBacteria\n                \nBacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Some people, especially the elderly and those who are disabled, may get bacterial pneumonia after having the flu or even a common cold.\n                \nMany types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a cold or the flu. This type of pneumonia often affects one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia.\n                \nThe most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is the bacterium Streptococcus (strep-to-KOK-us) pneumoniae, or pneumococcus (nu-mo-KOK-us).\n                \nLobar Pneumonia\n                \n\n                \nAnother type of bacterial pneumonia is called atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia includes:\n                \nLegionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains.\n                \nMycoplasma pneumonia. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However, mycoplasma pneumonia can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells).\n                \nChlamydophila pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old.\n                \nViruses\n                \nRespiratory viruses cause up to one-third of the pneumonia cases in the United States each year. These viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old.\n                \nMost cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital.\n                \nIf you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia as well.\n                \nThe flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Other viruses that cause pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and more.\n                \nFungi\n                \nThree types of fungi in the soil in some parts of the United States can cause pneumonia. These fungi are:\n                \nCoccidioidomycosis (kok-sid-e-OY-do-mi-KO-sis). This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest.\n                \nHistoplasmosis (HIS-to-plaz-MO-sis). This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.\n                \nCryptococcus (krip-to-KOK-us). This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.\n                \nMost people exposed to these fungi don't get sick, but some do and require treatment.\n                \nSerious fungal infections are most common in people who have weak immune systems due to the long-term use of medicines to suppress their immune systems or having HIV/AIDS.\n                \nPneumocystis jiroveci (nu-mo-SIS-tis ye-RO-VECH-e), formerly Pneumocystis carinii, sometimes is considered a fungal pneumonia. However, it's not treated with the usual antifungal medicines. This type of infection is most common in people who:\n                \nHave HIV/AIDS or cancer\n                \nHave had an organ transplant and/or blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nTake medicines that affect their immune systems\n                \nOther kinds of fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia."

                    "Answer": "Pneumonia can affect people of all ages. However, two age groups are at greater risk of developing pneumonia:\n                \nInfants who are 2 years old or younger (because their immune systems are still developing during the first few years of life)\n                \nPeople who are 65 years old or older\n                \nOther conditions and factors also raise your risk for pneumonia. You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have a lung disease or other serious disease. Examples include cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), bronchiectasis, diabetes, heart failure, and sickle cell anemia.\n                \nYou're at greater risk for pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive-care unit, especially if you're on a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe).\n                \nHaving a weak or suppressed immune system also raises your risk for pneumonia. A weak immune system may be the result of a disease such as HIV/AIDS. A suppressed immune system may be due to an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), or long-term steroid use.\n                \nYour risk for pneumonia also increases if you have trouble coughing because of a stroke or problems swallowing. You're also at higher risk if you can't move around much or are sedated (given medicine to make you relaxed or sleepy).\n                \nSmoking cigarettes, abusing alcohol, or being undernourished also raises your risk for pneumonia. Your risk also goes up if you've recently had a cold or the flu, or if you're exposed to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumes."

Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, including the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health. (For more information, go to \"Who Is at Risk for Pneumonia?\")\n                \nSee your doctor promptly if you:\n                \nHave a high fever\n                \nHave shaking chills\n                \nHave a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), which doesn't improve or worsens\n                \nDevelop shortness of breath with normal daily activities\n                \nHave chest pain when you breathe or cough\n                \nFeel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu\n                \nPeople who have pneumonia may have other symptoms, including nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, and diarrhea.\n                \nSymptoms may vary in certain populations. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Or, they may vomit, have a fever and cough, or appear restless, sick, or tired and without energy.\n                \nOlder adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. If they already have a lung disease, it may get worse. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness.\n                \nComplications of Pneumonia\n                \nOften, people who have pneumonia can be successfully treated and not have complications. But some people, especially those in high-risk groups, may have complications such as:\n                \nBacteremia (bak-ter-E-me-ah). This serious complication occurs if the infection moves into your bloodstream. From there, it can quickly spread to other organs, including your brain.\n                \nLung abscesses. An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. An abscess usually is treated with antibiotics. Sometimes surgery or drainage with a needle is needed to remove the pus.\n                \nPleural effusion. Pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the pleural space. This is a very thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and the chest cavity. Pneumonia can cause the fluid to become infecteda condition called empyema (em-pi-E-ma). If this happens, you may need to have the fluid drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery."

                    "Answer": "Pneumonia can be hard to diagnose because it may seem like a cold or the flu. You may not realize it's more serious until it lasts longer than these other conditions.\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose pneumonia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. To find out what type of germ is causing the pneumonia, he or she also may ask about:\n                \nAny recent traveling you've done\n                \nYour hobbies\n                \nYour exposure to animals\n                \nYour exposure to sick people at home, school, or work\n                \nYour past and current medical conditions, and whether any have gotten worse recently\n                \nAny medicines you take\n                \nWhether you smoke\n                \nWhether you've had flu or pneumonia vaccinations\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. If you have pneumonia, your lungs may make crackling, bubbling, and rumbling sounds when you inhale. Your doctor also may hear wheezing.\n                \nYour doctor may find it hard to hear sounds of breathing in some areas of your chest.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have pneumonia, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nA chest x ray is the best test for diagnosing pneumonia. However, this test won't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests involve taking a sample of blood from a vein in your body. A complete blood count (CBC) measures many parts of your blood, including the number of white blood cells in the blood sample. The number of white blood cells can show whether you have a bacterial infection.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a blood culture to find out whether the infection has spread to your bloodstream. This test is used to detect germs in the bloodstream. A blood culture may show which germ caused the infection. If so, your doctor can decide how to treat the infection.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other tests if you're in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems.\n                \nSputum test. Your doctor may look at a sample of sputum (spit) collected from you after a deep cough. This may help your doctor find out what germ is causing your pneumonia. Then, he or she can plan treatment.\n                \nChest computed tomography (CT) scan. A chest CT scan is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your lungs. A chest CT scan is a type of x ray, but its pictures show more detail than those of a standard chest xray.\n                \nPleural fluid culture. For this test, a fluid sample is taken from the pleural space (a thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity). Doctors use a procedure called thoracentesis (THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis) to collect the fluid sample. The fluid is studied for germs that may cause pneumonia.\n                \nPulse oximetry. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Pneumonia can keep your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n                \nIf you're very sick, your doctor may need to measure the level of oxygen in your blood using a blood sample. The sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. This test is called an arterial blood gas test.\n                \nBronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) is a procedure used to look inside the lungs' airways. If you're in the hospital and treatment with antibiotics isn't working well, your doctor may use this procedure.\n                \nYour doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose or mouth, down your throat, and into the airways. The tube has a light and small camera that allow your doctor to see your windpipe and airways and take pictures.\n                \nYour doctor can see whether something is blocking your airways or whether another factor is contributing to your pneumonia."

Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.\n                \nAlthough you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.\n                \nBacterial Pneumonia\n                \nBacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.\n                \nMost people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.\n                \nViral Pneumonia\n                \nAntibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.\n                \nViral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.\n                \nTreating Severe Symptoms\n                \nYou may need to be treated in a hospital if:\n                \nYour symptoms are severe\n                \nYou're at risk for complications because of other health problems\n                \nIf the level of oxygen in your bloodstream is low, you may receive oxygen therapy.
