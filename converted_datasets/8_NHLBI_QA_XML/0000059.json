                    "Answer": "Heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system. This system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (\"Rate\" refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. \"Rhythm\" refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.)\n                \nWith each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood.\n                \nHeart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHeart block is a type of arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah). An arrhythmia is any problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nSome people are born with heart block, while others develop it during their lifetimes. If you're born with the condition, it's called congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart block. If the condition develops after birth, it's called acquired heart block.\n                \nDoctors might detect congenital heart block before or after a baby is born. Certain diseases that may occur during pregnancy can cause heart block in a baby. Some congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\n                \nAcquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. Damage to the heart muscle or its electrical system causes acquired heart block. Diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause this damage.\n                \nThe three types of heart block are first degree, second degree, and third degree. First degree is the least severe, and third degree is the most severe. This is true for both congenital and acquired heart block.\n                \nDoctors use a test called an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. It maps the data on a graph for the doctor to review.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThe symptoms and severity of heart block depend on which type you have. First-degree heart block may not cause any severe symptoms.\n                \nSecond-degree heart block may result in the heart skipping a beat or beats. This type of heart block also can make you feel dizzy or faint.\n                \nThird-degree heart block limits the heart's ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. Third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal.\n                \nA medical device called a pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block and some cases of second-degree heart block. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. Pacemakers typically are not used to treat first-degree heart block.\n                \nAll types of heart block may increase your risk for other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fih-brih-LA-shun). Talk with your doctor to learn more about the signs and symptoms of arrhythmias."

                    "Answer": "Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).\n                \nCongenital Heart Block\n                \nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\n                \nIn pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\n                \nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\n                \nAcquired Heart Block\n                \nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\n                \nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block.\n                \nCoronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease.\n                \nMyocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis), or inflammation of the heart muscle.\n                \nHeart failure.\n                \nRheumatic (roo-MAT-ik) fever.\n                \nCardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-a-the), or heart muscle diseases.\n                \nOther diseases may increase the risk of heart block. Examples include sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DOE-sis) and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\n                \nCertain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block.\n                \nExposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicinesincluding digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockersalso may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems.\n                \nSome types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes).\n                \nAn overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\n                \nIn some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\n                \nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines."

These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes congenital heart defects.\n                \nHeredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect might be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition.\n                \nAcquired Heart Block\n                \nAcquired heart block can occur in people of any age. However, most types of the condition are more common in older people. This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people.\n                \nPeople who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are at increased risk for heart block. Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases).\n                \nOther diseases also may raise the risk of heart block, such as sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\n                \nExposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis, also can raise your risk for heart block.\n                \nWell-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate."

                    "Answer": "Heart block might be diagnosed as part of a routine doctor's visit or during an emergency situation. (Third-degree heart block often is an emergency.)\n                \nYour doctor will diagnose heart block based on your family and medical histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nYour primary care doctor might be involved in diagnosing heart block. However, if you have the condition, you might need to see a heart specialist. Heart specialists include:\n                \nCardiologists (doctors who diagnose and treat adults who have heart problems)\n                \nPediatric cardiologists (doctors who diagnose and treat babies and children who have heart problems)\n                \nElectrophysiologists (cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists who specialize in the heart's electrical system)\n                \nFamily and Medical Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether:\n                \nYou have any signs or symptoms of heart block\n                \nYou have any health problems, such as heart disease\n                \nAny of your family members have been diagnosed with heart block or other health problems\n                \nYou're taking any medicines, including herbal products and prescription and over-the-counter medicines\n                \nYou smoke or use alcohol or drugs\n                \nYour doctor also may ask about other health habits, such as how physically active you are.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart. He or she will listen carefully for abnormal rhythms or heart murmurs (extra or unusual sounds heard during heartbeats).\n                \nYour doctor also may:\n                \nCheck your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating\n                \nCheck for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure\n                \nLook for signs of other diseases that could be causing heart rate or rhythm problems (such as coronary heart disease)\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nDoctors usually use an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). The test also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nThe data are recorded on a graph. Different types of heart block have different patterns on the graph. (For more information, go to \"Types of Heart Block.\")\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heart's activity for a few seconds. To diagnose heart rhythm problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor.\n                \nThe most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors. Your doctor may have you use one of these monitors to diagnose first- or second-degree heart block.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nA Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.\n                \nAn event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.\n                \nYou may wear an event monitor for 1 to 2 months, or as long as it takes to get a recording of your heart during symptoms.\n                \nElectrophysiology Study\n                \nFor some cases of heart block, doctors may do electrophysiology studies (EPS). During this test, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records your heart's electrical signals.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nTo diagnose heart block, your doctor may recommend tests to rule out other types of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).

In an emergency, a temporary pacemaker might be used until you can get a long-term device. Most people who have third-degree heart block need pacemakers for the rest of their lives.\n                \nSome people who have third-degree congenital heart block don't need pacemakers for many years. Others may need pacemakers at a young age or during infancy.\n                \nIf a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. If heart block is detected in a fetus, the mother might be given medicine to reduce the fetus' risk of developing serious heart block.\n                \nSometimes acquired heart block goes away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\n                \nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the condition may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered.
