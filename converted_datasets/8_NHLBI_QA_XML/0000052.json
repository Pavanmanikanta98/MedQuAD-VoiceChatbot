                    "Answer": "The term \"diabetic heart disease\" (DHD) refers to heart disease that develops in people who have diabetes. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have diabetes:\n                \nAre at higher risk for heart disease\n                \nHave additional causes of heart disease\n                \nMay develop heart disease at a younger age\n                \nMay have more severe heart disease\n                \nWhat Is Diabetes?\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body doesn't make enough insulin. This causes the body's blood sugar level to rise.\n                \nIn type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly (a condition called insulin resistance). At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, though, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\n                \nFor more information about diabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Introduction to Diabetes Web page.\n                \nWhat Heart Diseases Are Involved in Diabetic Heart Disease?\n                \nDHD may include coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee).\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nIn CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nPlaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\n                \nPlaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nCHD can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh), irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart attack, or even death.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. The term heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\n                \nIf you have heart failure, you may tire easily and have to limit your activities. CHD can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart muscle over time.\n                \nDiabetic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nDiabetic cardiomyopathy is a disease that damages the structure and function of the heart. This disease can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias, even in people who have diabetes but don't have CHD.\n                \nOverview\n                \nPeople who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes can develop DHD. The higher a person's blood sugar level is, the higher his or her risk of DHD.\n                \nDiabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways.\n                \nFirst, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease, just like smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. In fact, people who have type 2 diabetes have the same risk of heart attack and dying from heart disease as people who already have had heart attacks.\n                \nSecond, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Although research is ongoing, it's clear that diabetes and other conditionssuch as overweight and obesity and metabolic syndromeinteract to cause harmful physical changes to the heart.\n                \nThird, diabetes raises the risk of earlier and more severe heart problems. Also, people who have DHD tend to have less success with some heart disease treatments, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention,also known as coronary angioplasty.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nIf you have diabetes, you can lower your risk of DHD. Making lifestyle changes and taking prescribed medicines can help you prevent or control many risk factors.\n                \nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors. For example, physical activity can lower your blood pressure, help control your blood sugar level and your weight, and reduce stress.\n                \nIt's also very important to follow your treatment plan for diabetes and see your doctor for ongoing care.\n                \nIf you already have DHD, follow your treatment plan as your doctors advises. This may help you avoid or delay serious problems, such as a heart attack or heart failure."

                    "Answer": "At least four complex processes, alone or combined, can lead to diabetic heart disease (DHD). They include coronary atherosclerosis; metabolic syndrome; insulin resistance in people who have type 2 diabetes; and the interaction of coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nResearchers continue to study these processes because all of the details aren't yet known.\n                \nCoronary Atherosclerosis\n                \nAtherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries. The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that it is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. The disease develops faster as you age.\n                \nCoronary atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. These factors include:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). When this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots narrow the coronary arteries even more. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and may worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of both CHD and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nIf you have three or more of the five metabolic risk factors, you have metabolic syndrome. The risk factors are:\n                \nA large waistline (a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women and 40 inches or more for men).\n                \nA high triglyceride (tri-GLIH-seh-ride) level (or youre on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\n                \nA low HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\n                \nHigh blood pressure (or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\n                \nA high fasting blood sugar level (or you're on medicine to treat high blood sugar).\n                \nIt's unclear whether these risk factors have a common cause or are mainly related by their combined effects on the heart.\n                \nObesity seems to set the stage for metabolic syndrome. Obesity can cause harmful changes in body fats and how the body uses insulin.\n                \nChronic (ongoing) inflammation also may occur in people who have metabolic syndrome. Inflammation is the body's response to illness or injury. It may raise your risk of CHD and heart attack. Inflammation also may contribute to or worsen metabolic syndrome.\n                \nResearch is ongoing to learn more about metabolic syndrome and how metabolic risk factors interact.\n                \nInsulin Resistance in People Who Have Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nType 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means that the body can't properly use the insulin it makes.\n                \nPeople who have type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have higher levels of substances in the blood that cause blood clots. Blood clots can block the coronary arteries and cause a heart attack or even death.\n                \nThe Interaction of Coronary Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure, and Diabetes\n                \nEach of these risk factors alone can damage the heart. CHD reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. High blood pressure and diabetes may cause harmful changes in the structure and function of the heart.\n                \nHaving CHD, high blood pressure, and diabetes is even more harmful to the heart. Together, these conditions can severely damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart has to work harder than normal. Over time, the heart weakens and isnt able to pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. This condition is called heart failure.\n                \nAs the heart weakens, the body may release proteins and other substances into the blood. These proteins and substances also can harm the heart and worsen heart failure."

                    "Answer": "People who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk for diabetic heart disease (DHD). Diabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways.\n                \nFirst, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease. Second, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Third, compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are more likely to:\n                \nHave heart attacks and other heart and blood vessel diseases. In men, the risk is double; in women, the risk is triple.\n                \nHave more complications after a heart attack, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart failure.\n                \nDie from heart disease.\n                \nThe higher your blood sugar level is, the higher your risk of DHD. (A higher than normal blood sugar level is a risk factor for heart disease even in people who don't have diabetes.)\n                \nType 2 diabetes raises your risk of having silent heart diseasethat is, heart disease with no signs or symptoms. You can even have a heart attack without feeling symptoms. Diabetes-related nerve damage that blunts heart pain may explain why symptoms aren't noticed.\n                \nOther Risk Factors\n                \nOther factors also can raise the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in people who have diabetes and in those who don't. You can control most of these risk factors, but some you can't.\n                \nFor a more detailed discussion of these risk factors, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors article.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can Control\n                \nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol).\n                \nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the body's tissues.\n                \nPrediabetes. This is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. If you have prediabetes and don't take steps to manage it, you'll likely develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.\n                \nOverweight or obesity. Being overweight or obese raises your risk of heart disease and heart attack. Overweight and obesity also are linked to other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.\n                \nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome also raises your risk of other health problems, such as stroke.\n                \nLack of physical activity. Lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for heart disease, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity.\n                \nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk of heart disease. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nStress. Stress and anxiety can trigger your arteries to tighten. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk of having a heart attack. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk of heart disease if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can't Control\n                \nAge. As you get older, your risk of heart disease and heart attack rises. In men, the risk of heart disease increases after age 45. In women, the risk increases after age 55. In people who have diabetes, the risk of heart disease increases after age 40.\n                \nGender. Before age 55, women seem to have a lower risk of heart disease than men. After age 55, however, the risk of heart disease increases similarly in both women and men.\n                \nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age.\n                \nPreeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure."

Diabetes-related nerve damage that blunts heart pain may explain why symptoms aren't noticed.\n                \nThus, people who have diabetes should have regular medical checkups. Tests may reveal a problem before they're aware of it. Early treatment can reduce or delay related problems.\n                \nSome people who have DHD will have some or all of the typical symptoms of heart disease. Be aware of the symptoms described below and seek medical care if you have them.\n                \nIf you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 right away for emergency care. Treatment for a heart attack works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nA common symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD) is angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.\n                \nSee your doctor if you think you have angina. He or she may recommend tests to check your coronary arteries and to see whether you have CHD risk factors.\n                \nOther CHD signs and symptoms include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness.\n                \nSome people don't realize they have CHD until they have a heart attack. A heart attack occurs if a blood clot forms in a coronary artery and blocks blood flow to part of the heart muscle.\n                \nThe most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back.\n                \nThe discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. The feeling can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn. Shortness of breath may occur with or before chest discomfort.\n                \nHeart attacks also can cause upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Other heart attack symptoms include nausea, vomiting, light-headedness or sudden dizziness, breaking out in a cold sweat, sleep problems, fatigue, and lack of energy.\n                \nSome heart attack symptoms are similar to angina symptoms. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack.\n                \nIf you don't know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911 right away for emergency care.\n                \nNot everyone who has a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. Also, diabetes-related nerve damage can interfere with pain signals in the body. As a result, some people who have diabetes may have heart attacks without symptoms.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nThe most common symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing, fatigue, and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in your neck. As the heart weakens, heart failure symptoms worsen.\n                \nPeople who have heart failure can live longer and more active lives if the condition is diagnosed early and they follow their treatment plans. If you have any form of DHD, talk with your doctor about your risk of heart failure.\n                \nDiabetic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nDiabetic cardiomyopathy may not cause symptoms in its early stages. Later, you may have weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet."

                    "Answer": "Your doctor will diagnose diabetic heart disease (DHD) based on your signs and symptoms, medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nDoctors and researchers are still trying to find out whether routine testing for DHD will benefit people who have diabetes but no heart disease symptoms.\n                \nInitial Tests\n                \nNo single test can diagnose DHD, which may involve coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy. Initially, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nBlood Pressure Measurement\n                \nTo measure your blood pressure, your doctor or nurse will use some type of a gauge, a stethoscope (or electronic sensor), and a blood pressure cuff.\n                \nMost often, you'll sit or lie down with the cuff around your arm as your doctor or nurse checks your blood pressure. If he or she doesn't tell you what your blood pressure numbers are, you should ask.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels of these substances may show that you're at risk for DHD.\n                \nA blood test also can check the level of a hormone called BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in your blood. The heart makes BNP, and the level of BNP rises during heart failure.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. Stress testing gives your doctor information about how your heart works during physical stress.\n                \nDuring a stress test, you exercise (walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. Tests are done on your heart while you exercise. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\n                \nUrinalysis\n                \nFor this test, you'll give a sample of urine for analysis. The sample is checked for abnormal levels of protein or blood cells. In people who have diabetes, protein in the urine is a risk factor for DHD.\n                \nOther Tests and Procedures\n                \nYour doctor may refer you to a cardiologist if your initial test results suggest that you have a form of DHD. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nThe cardiologist may recommend other tests or procedures to get more detailed information about the nature and extent of your DHD.\n                \nFor more information about other tests and procedures, go to the diagnosis sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles."

                    "Answer": "Diabetic heart disease (DHD) is treated with lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures. The goals of treating DHD include:\n                \nControlling diabetes and any other heart disease risk factors you have, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure\n                \nReducing or relieving heart disease symptoms, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort)\n                \nPreventing or delaying heart disease complications, such as a heart attack\n                \nRepairing heart and coronary artery damage\n                \nFollowing the treatment plan your doctor recommends is very important. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are at higher risk for heart disease, have additional causes of heart disease, may develop heart disease at a younger age, and may have more severe heart disease.\n                \nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nFollowing a healthy lifestyle is an important part of treating diabetes and DHD. Some people who have diabetes can manage their blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes alone.\n                \nFollowing a Healthy Diet\n                \nA healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\n                \nA healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nControlling your weight helps you control heart disease risk factors. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.\n                \nFor more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nBeing Physically Active\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many heart disease risk factors, and it helps control your blood sugar level. Physical activity also can improve how insulin works. (Insulin is a hormone that helps turn glucose into energy.)\n                \nGenerally, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. You dont have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about what types and amounts and physical activity are safe for you. People who have diabetes must be careful to watch their blood sugar levels and avoid injury to their feet during physical activity.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nSmoking can damage your blood vessels and raise your risk of heart disease. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that strong emotions, such as anger, can trigger a heart attack. Learning how to managestress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedicines are an important part of treatment for people who have diabetes and for people who have DHD.\n                \nMedicines can help control blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of blood clots, improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce the heart's workload, and treat angina symptoms.\n                \nYour doctor will prescribe medicines based on your specific needs.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nIf you have DHD, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease you have.\n                \nFor example, both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),also known as coronaryangioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are used to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). Both of these procedures improve blood flow to your heart. PCI also can relieve chest pain. CABG can relieve chest pain and may help prevent a heart attack.\n                \nIf you have heart damage and severe heart failure symptoms, your doctor may recommend a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\n                \nA CRT device is a type of pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that helps control abnormal heart rhythms. Its placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. A CRT device helps the heart's lower chambers contract at the same time, which may decrease heart failure symptoms.\n                \nAn ICD is similar to a pacemaker. An ICD is a small device thats placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. The device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control dangerous heart rhythms.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a pacemaker or ICD to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other types of surgery also are used to treat this type of heart disease.\n                \nFor more information about medical procedures used to treat diabetes-related heart diseases, go to the treatment sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles.\n                \nDiabetes-Specific Treatment Issues\n                \nThe treatments described above are used for people who have DHD and for people who have heart disease without diabetes. However, some aspects of heart disease treatment differ for people who have diabetes.\n                \nTreatment for High Blood Pressure and High Blood Cholesterol\n                \nTreatment for high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol often begins earlier in people who have diabetes than in those who don't. People who have diabetes also may have more aggressive treatment goals.\n                \nFor example, your doctor may prescribe medicines called statins even if your blood cholesterol levels are in the normal range. Your doctor also may prescribe statins if you're older than 40 and have other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nTarget goals for LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and high blood pressure also are lower for people who have diabetes than for those who don't. Studies suggest that most people who have diabetes will need more than one blood pressure medicine to reach their goals.\n                \nResearch also has shown that some people who have diabetes may benefit more from certain blood pressure and cholesterol medicines than from others.\n                \nOne example is a group of cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine). This type of medicine may offer advantages for people who have type 2 diabetes. It appears to improve blood sugar control and lower LDL cholesterol.\n                \nTreatment for Heart Failure\n                \nSome studies suggest that certain medicines may have advantages for treating heart failure in people who have diabetes. These medicines include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers.\n                \nResearch shows that two blood sugar medicines (insulin and sulfanylureas) don't seem to reduce the risk of heart failure in people who have type 2 diabetes. A third medicine (metformin) shows promise, but research is still ongoing.\n                \nHeart Attack Prevention\n                \nDoctors may recommend aspirin for people with diabetes who are at increased risk for heart disease and heart attack. Taken each day, low-dose aspirin may prevent blood clots that can lead to a heart attack.\n                \nPeople with diabetes who are at increased risk include most men older than 50 and most women older than 60 who have one or more of the following risk factors:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol\n                \nA family history of early heart disease\n                \nA higher than normal level of protein in their urine\n                \nBlood Sugar Control\n                \nControlling blood sugar levels is good for heart health. For example, controlling blood sugar improves everyday heart function for people who have diabetes and heart failure."

                    "Answer": "Taking action to control risk factors can help prevent or delay heart disease in people who have diabetes and in those who don't. Your risk of heart disease increases with the number of risk factors you have.\n                \nOne step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living. A healthy lifestyle includes:\n                \nFollowing a healthy diet\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nBeing physically active\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nYou also should know your family history of diabetes and heart disease. If you or someone in your family has diabetes, heart disease, or both, let your doctor know.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to control certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Take all of your medicines exactly as your doctor advises.\n                \nPeople who have diabetes also need good blood sugar control. Controlling your blood sugar level is good for heart health. Ask your doctor about the best ways to control your blood sugar level.\n                \nFor more information about lifestyle changes and medicines, go to \"How Is Diabetic Heart Disease Treated?\""
