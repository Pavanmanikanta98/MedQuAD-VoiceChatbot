                    "Answer": "Vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis) is a condition that involves inflammation in the blood vessels. The condition occurs if your immune system attacks your blood vessels by mistake. This may happen as the result of an infection, a medicine, or another disease or condition.\n                \nInflammation refers to the bodys response to injury, including injury to the blood vessels. Inflammation may involve pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and loss of function in the affected tissues.\n                \nIn vasculitis, inflammation can lead to serious problems. Complications depend on which blood vessels, organs, or other body systems are affected.\n                \nOverview\n                \nVasculitis can affect any of the body's blood vessels. These include arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood from your heart to your body's organs. Veins carry blood from your organs and limbs back to your heart. Capillaries connect the small arteries and veins.\n                \nIf a blood vessel is inflamed, it can narrow or close off. This limits or prevents blood flow through the vessel. Rarely, the blood vessel will stretch and weaken, causing it to bulge. This bulge is known as an aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\n                \nVasculitis\n                \n\n                \nThe disruption in blood flow caused by inflammation can damage the body's organs. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs have been damaged and the extent of the damage.\n                \nTypical symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and general aches and pains, are common among people who have vasculitis.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThere are many types of vasculitis, but overall the condition is rare. If you have vasculitis, the outlook depends on:\n                \nThe type of vasculitis you have\n                \nWhich organs are affected\n                \nHow quickly the condition worsens\n                \nThe severity of the condition\n                \nTreatment often works well if its started early. In some cases, vasculitis may go into remission. \"Remission\" means the condition isn't active, but it can come back, or \"flare,\" at any time.\n                \nSometimes vasculitis is chronic (ongoing) and never goes into remission. Long-term treatment with medicines often can control the signs and symptoms of chronic vasculitis.\n                \nRarely, vasculitis doesn't respond well to treatment. This can lead to disability and even death.\n                \nMuch is still unknown about vasculitis. However, researchers continue to learn more about the condition and its various types, causes, and treatments."

What causes this to happen isn't fully known.\n                \nA recent or chronic (ongoing) infection may prompt the attack. Your body also may attack its own blood vessels in reaction to a medicine.\n                \nSometimes an autoimmune disorder triggers vasculitis. Autoimmune disorders occur if the immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that attack and damage the body's own tissues or cells. Examples of these disorders include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. You can have these disorders for years before developing vasculitis.\n                \nVasculitis also may be linked to certain blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma."

                    "Answer": "The signs and symptoms of vasculitis vary. They depend on the type of vasculitis you have, the organs involved, and the severity of the condition. Some people may have few signs and symptoms. Other people may become very sick.\n                \nSometimes the signs and symptoms develop slowly, over months. Other times, the signs and symptoms develop quickly, over days or weeks.\n                \nSystemic Signs and Symptoms\n                \nSystemic signs and symptoms are those that affect you in a general or overall way. Common systemic signs and symptoms of vasculitis are:\n                \nFever\n                \nLoss of appetite\n                \nWeight loss\n                \nFatigue (tiredness)\n                \nGeneral aches and pains\n                \nOrgan- or Body System-Specific Signs and Symptoms\n                \nVasculitis can affect specific organs and body systems, causing a range of signs and symptoms.\n                \nSkin\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your skin, you may notice skin changes. For example, you may have purple or red spots or bumps, clusters of small dots, splotches, bruises, or hives. Your skin also may itch.\n                \nJoints\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your joints, you may ache or develop arthritis in one or more joints.\n                \nLungs\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your lungs, you may feel short of breath. You may even cough up blood. The results from a chest x ray may show signs that suggest pneumonia, even though that may not be what you have.\n                \nGastrointestinal Tract\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your gastrointestinal tract, you may get ulcers (sores) in your mouth or have stomach pain.\n                \nIn severe cases, blood flow to the intestines can be blocked. This can cause the wall of the intestines to weaken and possibly rupture (burst). A rupture can lead to serious problems or even death.\n                \nSinuses, Nose, Throat, and Ears\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your sinuses, nose, throat, and ears, you may have sinus or chronic (ongoing) middle ear infections. Other symptoms include ulcers in the nose and, in some cases, hearing loss.\n                \nEyes\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your eyes, you may develop red, itchy, burning eyes. Your eyes also may become sensitive to light, and your vision may blur. Rarely, certain types of vasculitis may cause blindness.\n                \nBrain\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your brain, symptoms may include headaches, problems thinking clearly, changes in mental function, or stroke-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness and paralysis (an inability to move).\n                \nNerves\n                \nIf vasculitis affects your nerves, you may have numbness, tingling, and weakness in various parts of your body. You also may have a loss of feeling or strength in your hands and feet and shooting pains in your arms and legs."

                    "Answer": "Your doctor will diagnose vasculitis based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nDepending on the type of vasculitis you have and the organs affected, your doctor may refer you to various specialists, including:\n                \nA rheumatologist (joint and muscle specialist)\n                \nAn infectious disease specialist\n                \nA dermatologist (skin specialist)\n                \nA pulmonologist (lung specialist)\n                \nA nephrologist (kidney specialist)\n                \nA neurologist (nervous system specialist)\n                \nA cardiologist (heart specialist)\n                \nAn ophthalmologist (eye specialist)\n                \nA urologist (urinary tract and urogenital system specialist)\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nMany tests are used to diagnose vasculitis.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests can show whether you have abnormal levels of certain blood cells and antibodies (proteins) in your blood. These tests may look at:\n                \nHemoglobin and hematocrit. A low hemoglobin or hematocrit level suggests anemia, a complication of vasculitis. Vasculitis can interfere with the body's ability to make enough red blood cells. Vasculitis also can be linked to increased destruction of red blood cells.\n                \nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). These antibodies are present in people who have certain types of vasculitis.\n                \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A high ESR may be a sign of inflammation in the body.\n                \nThe amount of C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. A high CRP level suggests inflammation.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nA biopsy often is the best way for your doctor to make a firm diagnosis of vasculitis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of your body tissue to study under a microscope. He or she will take the tissue sample from a blood vessel or an organ.\n                \nA pathologist will study the sample for signs of inflammation or tissue damage. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.\n                \nBlood Pressure\n                \nPeople who have vasculitis should have their blood pressure checked routinely. Vasculitis that damages the kidneys can cause high blood pressure.\n                \nUrinalysis\n                \nFor this test, you'll provide a urine sample for analysis. This test detects abnormal levels of protein or blood cells in the urine. Abnormal levels of these substances can be a sign of vasculitis affecting the kidneys.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. You might have this test to show whether vasculitis is affecting your heart.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Abnormal chest x-ray results may show whether vasculitis is affecting your lungs or your large arteries (such as the aorta or the pulmonary arteries).\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood.\n                \nLung function tests can help your doctor find out whether airflow into and out of your lungs is restricted or blocked.\n                \nAbdominal Ultrasound\n                \nAn abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the organs and structures in your abdomen. The picture may show whether vasculitis is affecting your abdominal organs.\n                \nComputed Tomography Scan\n                \nA computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or CT scan, is a type of x ray that creates more detailed pictures of your internal organs than a standard x ray. The results from this test can show whether you have a type of vasculitis that affects your abdominal organs or blood vessels.\n                \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\n                \nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your internal organs.\n                \nOther Advanced Imaging Techniques\n                \nSeveral new imaging techniques are now being used to help diagnose vasculitis. Duplex ultrasonography combines an image of the structure of the blood vessel with a color image of the blood flow through that vein or artery. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) identifies areas that show higher glucose metabolism leading to problems in the blood vessels.\n                \nAngiography\n                \nAngiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n                \nThe dye is injected into your bloodstream. Special x-ray pictures are taken while the dye flows through your blood vessels. The dye helps highlight the vessels on the x-ray pictures.\n                \nDoctors use angiography to help find out whether blood vessels are narrowed, swollen, deformed, or blocked."

Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.\n                \nThe main goal of treating vasculitis is to reduce inflammation in the affected blood vessels. This usually is done by reducing or stopping the immune response that caused the inflammation.\n                \nTypes of Treatment\n                \nCommon prescription medicines used to treat vasculitis include corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.\n                \nCorticosteroids help reduce inflammation in your blood vessels. Examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.\n                \nDoctors may prescribe cytotoxic medicines if vasculitis is severe or if corticosteroids don't work well. Cytotoxic medicines kill the cells that are causing the inflammation. Examples of these medicines are azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe both corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.\n                \nOther treatments may be used for certain types of vasculitis. For example, the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine thats injected into a vein.\n                \nCertain types of vasculitis may require surgery to remove aneurysms that have formed as a result of the condition.
