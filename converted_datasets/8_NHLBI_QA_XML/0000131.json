                    "Answer": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder. In TTP, blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body.\n                \nThe clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop.\n                \nThe increased clotting that occurs in TTP also uses up platelets (PLATE-lets) in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help form blood clots. These cell fragments stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\n                \nWith fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed inside their bodies, underneath the skin, or from the surface of the skin. When cut or injured, they also may bleed longer than normal.\n                \n\"Thrombotic\" (throm-BOT-ik) refers to the blood clots that form. \"Thrombocytopenic\" (throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick) means the blood has a lower than normal number of platelets. \"Purpura\" (PURR-purr-ah) refers to purple bruises caused by bleeding under the skin.\n                \nBleeding under the skin also can cause tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash.\n                \nPurpura and Petechiae\n                \n\n                \nTTP also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. This leads to hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh)a rare form of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nA lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme (a type of protein in the blood) causes TTP. The ADAMTS13 gene controls the enzyme, which is involved in blood clotting. The enzyme breaks up a large protein called von Willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots.\n                \nTypes of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n                \nThe two main types of TTP are inherited and acquired. \"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. This type of TTP mainly affects newborns and children.\n                \nIn inherited TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene is faulty and doesn't prompt the body to make a normal ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, enzyme activity is lacking or changed.\n                \nAcquired TTP is the more common type of the disorder. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it. This type of TTP mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children.\n                \nIn acquired TTP, the ADAMTS13 gene isn't faulty. Instead, the body makes antibodies (proteins) that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \nIt's not clear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include:\n                \nSome diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections\n                \nSome medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nSome medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, and hormone therapy and estrogens\n                \nQuinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products\n                \nIf you have TTP, you may sometimes hear it referred to as TTPHUS. HUS, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, is a disorder that resembles TTP, but is more common in children. Kidney problems also tend to be worse in HUS. Although some researchers think TTP and HUS are two forms of a single syndrome, recent evidence suggests that each has different causes.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nTTP is a rare disorder. It can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it's not treated right away.\n                \nTTP usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can continue for months. Relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired type of TTP. Many people who have inherited TTP have frequent flareups that need to be treated.\n                \nTreatments for TTP include infusions of fresh frozen plasma and plasma exchange, also called plasmapheresis (PLAZ-ma-feh-RE-sis). These treatments have greatly improved the outlook of the disorder."

                    "Answer": "Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nIf TTP is suspected or diagnosed, a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example, he or she may ask whether you:\n                \nHave certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer, HIV, lupus, or infections (or whether you're pregnant).\n                \nHave had previous medical procedures, such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant.\n                \nTake certain medicines, such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, or hormone therapy and estrogens, or whether you've had chemotherapy.\n                \nHave used any products that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nAs part of the medical history and physical exam, your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms you've had. He or she will look for signs such as:\n                \nBruising and bleeding under your skin\n                \nFever\n                \nPaleness or jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes)\n                \nA fast heart rate\n                \nSpeech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out\n                \nChanges in urine\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have TTP.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nThis test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nIf you have TTP, you'll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells (anemia).\n                \nBlood Smear\n                \nFor this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP, the red blood cells are torn and broken.\n                \nPlatelet Count\n                \nThis test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP.\n                \nBilirubin Test\n                \nWhen red blood cells die, they release a protein called hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice.\n                \nFor this blood test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP, your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal.\n                \nKidney Function Tests and Urine Tests\n                \nThese tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP, your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also, your blood creatinine (kre-AT-ih-neen) level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that's normally removed by the kidneys.\n                \nCoombs Test\n                \nThis blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nIn TTP, hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots.\n                \nWhen TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia, the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies (proteins) are destroying your red blood cells.\n                \nLactate Dehydrogenase Test\n                \nThis blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nHemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP.\n                \nADAMTS13 Assay\n                \nA lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzyme's activity."

Relapses (flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have acquired TTP. Flareups also occur in most people who have inherited TTP.\n                \nPlasma treatments are the most common way to treat TTP. Other treatments include medicines and surgery. Treatments are done in a hospital.\n                \nPlasma Therapy\n                \nPlasma is the liquid part of your blood. It carries blood cells, hormones, enzymes, and nutrients to your body.\n                \nTTP is treated with plasma therapy. This includes:\n                \nFresh frozen plasma for people who have inherited TTP\n                \nPlasma exchange for people who have acquired TTP\n                \nPlasma therapy is started in the hospital as soon as TTP is diagnosed or suspected.\n                \nFor inherited TTP, fresh frozen plasma is given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. This is done to replace the missing or changed ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \nPlasma exchange (also called plasmapheresis) is used to treat acquired TTP. This is a lifesaving procedure. It removes antibodies (proteins) from the blood that damage your ADAMTS13 enzyme. Plasma exchange also replaces the ADAMTS13 enzyme.\n                \nIf plasma exchange isn't available, you may be given fresh frozen plasma until it is available.\n                \nDuring plasma exchange, an IV needle or tube is placed in a vein in your arm to remove blood. The blood goes through a cell separator, which removes plasma from the blood. The nonplasma part of the blood is saved, and donated plasma is added to it.\n                \nThen, the blood is put back into you through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels. The time required to complete the procedure varies, but it often takes about 2hours.\n                \nTreatments of fresh frozen plasma or plasma exchange usually continue until your blood tests results and signs and symptoms improve. This can take days or weeks, depending on your condition. You'll stay in the hospital while you recover.\n                \nSome people who recover from TTP have flareups. This can happen in the hospital or after you go home. If you have a flareup, your doctor will restart plasma therapy.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nOther treatments are used if plasma therapy doesn't work well or if flareups occur often.\n                \nFor acquired TTP, medicines can slow or stop antibodies to the ADAMTS13 enzyme from forming. Medicines used to treat TTP include glucocorticoids, vincristine, rituximab, and cyclosporine A.\n                \nSometimes surgery to remove the spleen (an organ in the abdomen) is needed. This is because cells in the spleen make the antibodies that block ADAMTS13 enzyme activity."
