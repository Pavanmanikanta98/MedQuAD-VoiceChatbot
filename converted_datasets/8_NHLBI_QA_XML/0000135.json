                    "Answer": "Espaol\n                \nVaricose (VAR-i-kos) veins are swollen, twisted veins that you can see just under the surface of the skin. These veins usually occur in the legs, but they also can form in other parts of the body.\n                \nVaricose veins are a common condition. They usually cause few signs and symptoms. Sometimes varicose veins cause mild to moderate pain, blood clots, skin ulcers (sores), or other problems.\n                \nOverview\n                \nVeins are blood vessels that carry blood from your body's tissues to your heart. Your heart pumps the blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then is pumped to your body through blood vessels called arteries.\n                \nFrom your arteries, the blood flows through tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where it gives up its oxygen to the body's tissues. Your blood then returns to your heart through your veins to pick up more oxygen. For more information about blood flow, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.\n                \nVeins have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell, which can lead to varicose veins.\n                \nMany factors can raise your risk for varicose veins. Examples of these factors include family history, older age, gender, pregnancy, overweight or obesity, lack of movement, and leg trauma.\n                \nVaricose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nVaricose veins usually don't cause medical problems. If they do, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes.\n                \nSometimes varicose veins cause pain, blood clots, skin ulcers, or other problems. If this happens, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. Some people choose to have these procedures to improve the way their veins look or to relieve pain.\n                \nMany treatments for varicose veins are quick and easy and don't require a long recovery."

                    "Answer": "Weak or damaged valves in the veins can cause varicose veins. After your arteries and capillaries deliver oxygen-rich blood to your body, your veins return the blood to your heart. The veins in your legs must work against gravity to do this.\n                \nOne-way valves inside the veins open to let blood flow through, and then they shut to keep blood from flowing backward. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins. This causes the veins to swell.\n                \nWeak vein walls may cause weak valves. Normally, the walls of the veins are elastic (stretchy). If these walls become weak, they lose their normal elasticity. They become like an overstretched rubber band. This makes the walls of the veins longer and wider, and it causes the flaps of the valves to separate.\n                \nWhen the valve flaps separate, blood can flow backward through the valves. The backflow of blood fills the veins and stretches the walls even more. As a result, the veins get bigger, swell, and often twist as they try to squeeze into their normal space. These are varicose veins.\n                \nNormal Vein and Varicose Vein\n                \n\n                \nFigure A shows a normal vein with a working valve and normal blood flow. Figure B shows a varicose vein with a deformed valve, abnormal blood flow, and thin, stretched walls. The middle image shows where varicose veins might appear in a leg.\n                \nOlder age or a family history of varicose veins may raise your risk for weak vein walls. You also may be at higher risk if you have increased pressure in your veins due to overweight or obesity or pregnancy."

                    "Answer": "Many factors may raise your risk for varicose veins, including family history, older age, gender, pregnancy, overweight or obesity, lack of movement, and leg trauma.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving family members who have varicose veins may raise your risk for the condition. About half of all people who have varicose veins have a family history of them.\n                \nOlder Age\n                \nGetting older may raise your risk for varicose veins. The normal wear and tear of aging may cause the valves in your veins to weaken and not work well.\n                \nGender\n                \nWomen tend to get varicose veins more often than men. Hormonal changes that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause (or with the use of birth control pills) may raise a woman's risk for varicose veins.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nDuring pregnancy, the growing fetus puts pressure on the veins in the mother's legs. Varicose veins that occur during pregnancy usually get better within 3 to 12 months of delivery.\n                \nOverweight or Obesity\n                \nBeing overweight or obese can put extra pressure on your veins. This can lead to varicose veins. For more information about overweight and obesity, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nLack of Movement\n                \nStanding or sitting for a long time, especially with your legs bent or crossed, may raise your risk for varicose veins. This is because staying in one position for a long time may force your veins to work harder to pump blood to your heart.\n                \nLeg Trauma\n                \nPrevious blood clots or traumatic damage to the valves in your veins can weaken their ability to move blood back to the heart, increasing the risk for varicose veins."

                    "Answer": "The signs and symptoms of varicose veins include:\n                \nLarge veins that you can see just under the surface of your skin.\n                \nMild swelling of your ankles and feet.\n                \nPainful, achy, or \"heavy\" legs.\n                \nThrobbing or cramping in your legs.\n                \nItchy legs, especially on the lower leg and ankle. Sometimes this symptom is incorrectly diagnosed as dry skin.\n                \nDiscolored skin in the area around the varicose vein.\n                \nSigns of telangiectasias are clusters of red veins that you can see just under the surface of your skin. These clusters usually are found on the upper body, including the face. Signs of spider veins are red or blue veins in a web or tree branch pattern. Often, these veins appear on the legs and face.\n                \nSee your doctor if you have these signs and symptoms. They also may be signs of other, more serious conditions.\n                \nComplications of Varicose Veins\n                \nVaricose veins can lead to dermatitis (der-ma-TI-tis), an itchy rash. If you have varicose veins in your legs, dermatitis may affect your lower leg or ankle. Dermatitis can cause bleeding or skin ulcers (sores) if the skin is scratched or irritated.\n                \nVaricose veins also can lead to a condition called superficial thrombophlebitis (THROM-bo-fleh-BI-tis). Thrombophlebitis is a blood clot in a vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis means that the blood clot occurs in a vein close to the surface of the skin. This type of blood clot may cause pain and other problems in the affected area."

                    "Answer": "Doctors often diagnose varicose veins based on a physical exam alone. Sometimes tests or procedures are used to find out the extent of the problem or to rule out other conditions.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nIf you have varicose veins, you may see a vascular medicine specialist or vascular surgeon. These doctors specialize in blood vessel conditions. You also may see a dermatologist. This type of doctor specializes in skin conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nTo check for varicose veins in your legs, your doctor will look at your legs while you're standing or sitting with your legs dangling. He or she may ask you about your signs and symptoms, including any pain you're having.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nDuplex Ultrasound\n                \nYour doctor may recommend duplex ultrasound to check blood flow in your veins and to look for blood clots. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional with Doppler ultrasound. Traditional ultrasound uses sound waves to create apicture of the structures in your body, in this case the blood vessels and anything that may be blocking the flow of blood. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the flow or movement of the blood through theveins. The two types of ultrasound together paint a picture that helps your doctor diagnose your condition.\n                \nDuring this test, a handheld device will be placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. The device sends and receives sound waves. A computer will convert the sound waves into a picture of the blood flow in your arteries and veins.\n                \nAngiogram\n                \nAlthough it is not very common, your doctor may recommend an angiogram to get a more detailed look at the blood flow through your veins.\n                \nFor this procedure, dye is injected into your veins. The dye outlines your veins on x-ray images.\n                \nAn angiogram can help your doctor confirm whether you have varicose veins or another condition."

                    "Answer": "Varicose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance.\n                \nIf varicose veins cause few symptoms, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes. If your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. For example, you may need a medical procedure if you have a lot of pain, blood clots, or skin disorders caused by your varicose veins.\n                \nSome people who have varicose veins choose to have procedures to improve how their veins look.\n                \nAlthough treatment can help existing varicose veins, it can't keep new varicose veins from forming.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes often are the first treatment for varicose veins. These changes can prevent varicose veins from getting worse, reduce pain, and delay other varicose veins from forming. Lifestyle changes include the following:\n                \nAvoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. When sitting, avoid crossing your legs. Keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. When you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.\n                \nDo physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. This helps blood move through your veins.\n                \nIf you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.\n                \nAvoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. Tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.\n                \nAvoid wearing high heels for long periods. Lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. Toned muscles help blood move through the veins.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend compression stockings. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. This pressure keeps blood from pooling and decreases swelling in the legs.\n                \nThere are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose. These offer the least amount of pressure. A second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.\n                \nPrescription-strength compression hose are the third type of compression stockings. These stockings offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, you need to be fitted for them in the store by a specially trained person.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nMedical procedures are done either to remove varicose veins or to close them. Removing or closing varicose veins usually doesn't cause problems with blood flow because the blood starts moving through other veins.\n                \nYou may be treated with one or more of the procedures described below. Common side effects right after most of these procedures include bruising, swelling, skin discoloration, and slight pain.\n                \nThe side effects are most severe with vein stripping and ligation (li-GA-shun). Rarely, this procedure can cause severe pain, infections, blood clots, and scarring.\n                \nSclerotherapy\n                \nSclerotherapy (SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) uses a liquid chemical to close off a varicose vein. The chemical is injected into the vein to cause irritation and scarring inside the vein. The irritation and scarring cause the vein to close off, and it fades away.\n                \nThis procedure often is used to treat smaller varicose veins and spider veins. It can be done in your doctor's office, while you stand. You may need several treatments to completely close off a vein.\n                \nTreatments typically are done every 4 to 6 weeks. Following treatments, your legs will be wrapped in elastic bandaging to help with healing and decrease swelling.\n                \nMicrosclerotherapy\n                \nMicrosclerotherapy (MI-kro-SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) is used to treat spider veins and other very small varicose veins.\n                \nA small amount of liquid chemical is injected into a vein using a very fine needle. The chemical scars the inner lining of the vein, causing it to close off.\n                \nLaser Surgery\n                \nThis procedure applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein. The laser light makes the vein fade away.\n                \nLaser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins. No cutting or injection of chemicals is involved.\n                \nEndovenous Ablation Therapy\n                \nEndovenous ablation (ab-LA-shun) therapy uses lasers or radiowaves to create heat to close off a varicose vein.\n                \nYour doctor makes a tiny cut in your skin near the varicose vein. He or she then inserts a small tube called a catheter into the vein. A device at the tip of the tube heats up the inside of the vein and closes it off.\n                \nYou'll be awake during this procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. You usually can go home the same day as the procedure.\n                \nEndoscopic Vein Surgery\n                \nFor endoscopic (en-do-SKOP-ik) vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near a varicose vein. He or she then uses a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. A surgical device at the end of the camera is used to close the vein.\n                \nEndoscopic vein surgery usually is used only in severe cases when varicose veins are causing skin ulcers (sores). After the procedure, you usually can return to your normal activities within a few weeks.\n                \nAmbulatory Phlebectomy\n                \nFor ambulatory phlebectomy (fle-BEK-to-me), your doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small varicose veins. This procedure usually is done to remove the varicose veins closest to the surface of your skin.\n                \nYou'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. Usually, you can go home the same day that the procedure is done.\n                \nVein Stripping and Ligation\n                \nVein stripping and ligation typically is done only for severe cases of varicose veins. The procedure involves tying shut and removing the veins through small cuts in your skin.\n                \nYou'll be given medicine to temporarily put you to sleep so you don't feel any pain during the procedure.\n                \nVein stripping and ligation usually is done as an outpatient procedure. The recovery time from the procedure is about 1 to 4 weeks."
