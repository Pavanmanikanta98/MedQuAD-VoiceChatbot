                "Answer": "Malakoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory disease. It commonly involves the urinary tract, but may also involve the prostate, ureter, pelvis, bones, lungs, testes, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidney.  Malakoplakia of the kidney is often associated with chronic kidney infection and obstruction. E. coli  is the most common organism found in urine samples. Common symptoms of malakoplakia of the kidney include flank pain and signs of active kidney infection. It may affect one or both kidneys and can cause symptoms similar to that of kidney failure.Careful studies of the involved tissues can help to distinguish malakoplakia of the kidney from similar conditions, namely xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and megalocytic interstitial nephritis."
