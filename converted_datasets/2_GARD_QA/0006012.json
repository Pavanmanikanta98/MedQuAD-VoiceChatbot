                    "Answer": "Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that is characterized by pain in the ankle, foot, and toes. This condition is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve, which runs through a canal near the heel into the sole of the foot. When tissues around this nerve become inflamed, they can press on the nerve and cause the pain associated with tarsal tunnel syndrome."

                    "Answer": "What symptoms are commonly seen in tarsal tunnel syndrome? The symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome can vary from person to person. The most common symptom of tarsal tunnel syndrome is foot and ankle pain. Individuals may also experience a burning or tingling sensation and numbness. These symptoms may occur when a person stands, walks, or wears a particular type of shoe. Pain usually worsens during walking and is relieved by rest."

                    },
                    "Answer": "What causes tarsal tunnel syndrome? There are a variety of factors that may cause tarsal tunnel syndrome. These may include repetitive stress with activities, trauma (e.g., crush injury, stretch injury, fractures, ankle dislocations or sprains), flat feet, and excess weight. Additionally, any lesion that occupies space within the tarsal tunnel region may cause pressure on the nerve and subsequent symptoms. Examples include tendonitis, hematoma, tumor, varicose veins, and lower extremity edema."
