The condition is actually a grouping of three closely linked conditions: Cogan-Reese syndrome; Chandler's syndrome; and essential (progressive) iris atrophy. The cause of ICE syndrome is unknown, however there is a theory that it is triggered by a virus that leads to swelling of the cornea. While there is no way to stop the progression of the condition, treatment of the symptoms may include medication for glaucoma and corneal transplant for corneal swelling."

                    "Answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome? The most common feature of ICE syndrome is the movement of endothelial cells off the cornea onto the iris. This loss of cells from the cornea often leads to swelling of the cornea, distortion of the iris, and variable degrees of distortion of the pupil (the adjustable opening at the center of the iris that allows varying amounts of light to enter the eye). This cell movement also plugs the fluid outflow channels of the eye, causing glaucoma."

                    "Answer": "How might iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome be treated? It is not possible to halt the progression of ICE syndrome. Treatment is usually focused on managing the glaucoma associated with the disease, either through medication or possible surgery, to help reduce pressure in the eye. Medication and corneal transplant can also be used to treat corneal swelling."
