                    "Answer": "Brown syndrome is an eye disorder characterized by abnormalities in the eye's ability to move. Specifically, the ability to look up and in is affected by a problem in the superior oblique muscle/tendon. The condition may be present at birth (congenital) or it may develop following surgery or as a result of inflammation or a problem with development. Some cases are constant while other are intermittent. Treatment depends upon the cause and severity of the movement disorder. Options include close observation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents like Ibuprofen, corticosteroids, and surgery."

                    },
                    "Answer": "How might Brown syndrome be treated? Treatment recommendations vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. In mild cases, a watch and wait approach may be sufficient. Visual acuity should be monitored. First line therapy usually involves less invasive options such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen.  Acquired cases of inflammatory Brown syndrome may be successfully treated with corticosteroids. Surgery is considered in cases which present with double vision, compromised binocular vision, significant abnormalities in head position or obvious eye misalignment when looking straight ahead.
