                "Answer": "Phaeohyphomycosis refers to fungal infections caused by dematiaceous (darkly, pigmented fungi). It can be associated with a variety of clinical syndromes including invasive sinusitis; nodules or abscesses beneath the skin; keratitis; lung masses; osteomyelitis; mycotic arthritis; endocarditis; brain abscess; and wide-spread infection. Although the condition can affect all people, it is most commonly diagnosed in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people and can even be life-threatening in these populations. Treatment depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include surgery and/or various medications."
