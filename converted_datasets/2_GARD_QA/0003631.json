                    "Answer": "Lipodermatosclerosis refers to changes in the skin of the lower legs. It is a form of panniculitis (inflammation of the layer of fat under the skin). Signs and symptoms include pain, hardening of skin, change in skin color (redness), swelling, and a tapering of the legs above the ankles. The exact underlying cause is unknown; however, it appears to be associated with venous insufficiency and/or obesity. Treatment usually includes compression therapy."

Lipodermatosclerosis often occurs in people with venous insufficiency. Approximately two thirds of affected people are obese."

                    "Answer": "How is lipodermatosclerosis diagnosed? Lipodermatosclerosis is usually diagnosed based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. A skin biopsy and/or blood tests are usually not required to confirm a diagnosis but may be performed in rare cases. Ultrasound scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to obtain more information regarding the severity of the condition and to determine the best treatment approach."

                    },
                    "Answer": "How might lipodermatosclerosis be treated? Lipodermatosclerosis is primarily treated with compression therapy to improve venous insufficiency. Other strategies for managing venous insufficiency include leg elevation; not sitting or standing in one place for long periods of time; regular exercise; and weight loss if overweight or obese. Some affected people may require medications to prevent blood clotting; reduce pain and inflammation; and/or increase blood flow. Depending on the severity of the condition and the response to initial treatments, vein surgery may be recommended."
