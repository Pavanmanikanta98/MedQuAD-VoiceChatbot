                "Answer": "Retinochoroidal coloboma is an eye abnormality that occurs before birth. It is characterized by missing pieces of tissue in both the retina (the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye) and choroid (the blood vessel layer under the retina). In many cases, retinochoroidal coloboma does not cause symptoms. However, complications such as retinal detachment may occur at any age. Other possible complications include loss of visual clarity or distorted vision; cataract; and abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid (choroidal neovascularization). Retinochoroidal coloboma can involve one or both eyes, and may occur alone or in association with other birth defects. It can be inherited or can occur sporadically."
