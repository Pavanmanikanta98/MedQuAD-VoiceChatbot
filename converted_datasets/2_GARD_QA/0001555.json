                "Answer": "Congenital short femur is a rare type of skeletal dysplasia, a complex group of bone and cartilage disorders that affect the skeleton of a fetus as it develops during pregnancy. Congenital short femur can vary in severity, ranging from hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the femur to absence of the femur. With modern surgery techniques and expertise, lengthening the shortened femur may be an option for some patients. However surgical lengthening of the femur remains a challenging procedure with risks for complications."
