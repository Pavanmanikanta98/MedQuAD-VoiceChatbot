                "Answer": "Juvenile spondyloarthropathy refers to a group of rheumatic diseases that develop during childhood and are characterized by inflammation of the entheses (the regions where tendons or ligaments attach to bones) and joints. The joints of the lower extremities are generally affected first followed by the sacroiliac joints (between the pelvis and the spine) and spinal joints some years later. Signs and symptoms may include pain and swelling of the affected entheses and joints that may be misdiagnosed and treated as an injury. The underlying cause of juvenile spondyloarthropathy is currently unknown; however, the condition is strongly associated with HLA-B27. Some cases appear to occur sporadically while other affected people have a family history of arthritis, or other related condition. Treatment varies based on the type of juvenile spondyloarthropathy but may include various medications."
