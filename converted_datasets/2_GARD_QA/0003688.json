The symptoms of lupus nephritis include blood in the urine, a foamy appearance to the urine, high blood pressure, and swelling in any part of the body. This condition typically occurs in people aged 20 to 40 years. Treatment may involve medications to suppress the immune system, dialysis, or a kidney transplant.
