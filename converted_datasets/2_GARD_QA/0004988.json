                "Answer": "Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in branches of the portal vein, the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver. Portal hypertension itself does not cause symptoms, but complications from the condition can lead to an enlarged abdomen, abdominal discomfort, confusion, drowsiness and internal bleeding. It may be caused by a variety of conditions, but cirrhosis is the most common cause in Western countries. Treatment is generally directed toward the cause of the condition, although emergency treatment is sometimes needed for serious complications."
