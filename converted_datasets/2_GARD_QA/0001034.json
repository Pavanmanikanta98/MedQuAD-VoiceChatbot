                "Answer": "Central serous chorioretinopathy is a disease that causes fluid to build up under the retina, the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The fluid leaks from the choroid (the blood vessel layer under the retina). The cause of this condition is unknown but stress can be a risk factor. Signs and symptoms include dim and blurred blind spot in the center of vision, distortion of straight lines and seeing objects as smaller or farther away. Many cases of central serous chorioretinopathy improve without treatment after 1-2 months. Laser treatment may be an option for other individuals."
