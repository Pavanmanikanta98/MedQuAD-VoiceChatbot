                "Answer": "A prolactinoma is a tumor of the pituitary gland, which controls production of many hormones.  A prolactinoma causes increased levels of the hormone prolactin.  The symptoms of prolactinoma may include unusual milk production (galactorrhea) or no menstrual cycles (amenorrhea) in women or decreased sex drive in men.  Most prolactinomas occur by chance (sporadically); in a small number of cases, prolactinoma may be associated with an inherited condition such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or other genetic factor."
