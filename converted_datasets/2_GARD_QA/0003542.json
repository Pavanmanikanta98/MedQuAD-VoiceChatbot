                "Answer": "Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) is a type of skin cancer that usually develops in older, fair-skinned adults.  The average age of diagnosis is 65.  LMM is thought to be caused by a history of sun exposure to the affected area.  Treatment includes surgery to remove as much of the LMM as possible."
