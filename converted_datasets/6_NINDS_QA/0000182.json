                    "answer": "Lipid storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders in which harmful amounts of fatty materials (lipids) accumulate in various tissues and cells in the body.\u00a0 Lipids are important parts of the membranes found within and between each cell and in the myelin sheath that coats and protects the nerves. \u00a0Over time, this excessive storage of fats can cause permanent cellular and tissue damage, particularly in the brain, peripheral nervous system, liver, spleen, and bone marrow.\u00a0 Lipid storage diseases are inherited from one or both parents who carry a defective gene. \u00a0 Symptoms may appear early in life or develop in the teen or even adult years.\u00a0 Neurological complications of the lipid storage diseases may include lack of muscle coordination, brain degeneration, seizures, loss of muscle tone, learning problems, spasticity, feeding and swallowing difficulties, slurred speech, hypersensitivity to touch,\u00a0pain in the arms and legs, and clouding of the cornea."

                    "answer": "Currently there is no specific treatment available for most of the lipid storage disorders, although Gaucher and Fabry diseases have effective enzyme replacement therapies.\u00a0 Eligustat tartrate has been approved to reduce excess buildup in Gaucher disease. \u00a0Other treatment is supportive.\u00a0 Doctors often prescribe corticosteroids and anticonvulsants to relieve pain.\u00a0 Anticonvulsant medications are often used to control seizures. Restricting one's diet does not prevent lipid buildup in cells and tissues."

                    "answer": "The prognosis for a lipid storage disorder is determined by the type of disease, the age of onset, and the severity of symptoms.\u00a0 Children treated for some forms of Gaucher disease may live well into adulthood, while children with Niemann-Pick disease often die at a young age from infection or progressive neurological loss.\u00a0 Children with Fabry disease often die prematurely of complications from heart disease, renal failure, or stroke.\u00a0 Most children with Farber\u2019s disease die by age 2, usually from lung disease.\u00a0 Children with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases often die at an early age from recurring or respiratory infection."
