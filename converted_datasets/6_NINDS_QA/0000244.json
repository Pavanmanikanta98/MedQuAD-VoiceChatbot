                    "answer": "Psychogenic movement is an unwanted muscle movement such as a spasm or tremor that is caused by an underlying psychological condition. Psychogenic movement can involve any part of the body and resemble the same muscle movements that occur with a biological condition or structural abnormality.\u00a0Most psychogenic movement is involuntary\u2014done without being consciously initiated by the individual. Psychogenic movement may develop as part of a conversion disorder (in which a psychological event causes physical symptoms with no known medical cause).\u00a0It also may result from a somatoform disorder (characterized predominantly by multi-system symptoms that are associated with distress and/or dysfunction), factitious disorder (an illness that simulates symptoms for psychological reasons), or malingering (not characterized as a psychiatric disorder but where illness is pretended as a way to achieve a secondary goal such as the acquisition of drugs or disability benefits).\u00a0Unlike movement disorders caused by biological or structural conditions, psychogenic movement disorders commonly develop suddenly, progress rapidly to maximum severity, may increase in intensity, and come and go with complete or partial remissions. \u00a0The movement may be less when the person is distracted, and the severity of symptoms varies among individuals.\u00a0 The course of the psychological condition may be short-lived or lead to chronic disability.\n                \nPsychogenic movement is uncommon before the age of 10 years.\u00a0In children, the dominant limb is most often affected, while adults most frequently see movement in the nondominant limb.\n                \nPsychogenic movement disorders include:\n                \nPsychogenic tremor (also called functional tremor) can appear as any form of tremor movement.\u00a0Characteristics may vary but generally include sudden onset and remission, increased incidence with stress, change in tremor direction and/or body part affected, and greatly decreased or disappearing tremor activity when the person is being distracted.\u00a0Many individuals with psychogenic tremor have a conversion disorder.\n                \nPsychogenic dystonia involves involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow, repetitive movements or abnormal postures that are often severely painful.\u00a0Onset may be abrupt or appear as part of a recurring attack.\u00a0Psychogenic dystonia typically involves fixed postures, particularly from the start, whereas dystonia caused by a muscle or structural abnormality tends to involve more mobility and be action induced.\n                \nPsychogenic myoclonus refers to sudden, involuntary muscle contractions (twitches) or jerking of a muscle or group of muscles that are caused by a psychological condition.\u00a0Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence, in a pattern or without pattern.\u00a0Increased startle or startle-like movements are frequent.\u00a0Psychogenic myoclonus may occur spontaneously or be generated by an action or reflex.\u00a0The twitching cannot be controlled by the person experiencing it.\n                \nPsychogenic parkinsonism involves rigid movements that are extremely slow and often associated with a great sense of effort and rapid onset of severe fatigue.\u00a0Individuals with psychogenic parkinsonism may also have tremor.\u00a0Symptoms are usually seen on both sides of the body.\n                \nPsychogenic gait disturbances feature unusual patterns of stance and gait.\u00a0Individuals may stagger or veer from side to side when walking and appear to be losing their balance, but only rarely fall.\u00a0Sudden knee buckling without falling is common."

                    "answer": "No single test can confirm psychogenic movement, which can prove difficult to diagnose.\u00a0Physicians must rule out co-existing conditions and other recognizable movement disorders.\u00a0There may be fluctuations during a neurological exam\u2014particularly an increase of movement following attention and suggestion (an external influence on the will of the patient), and a decrease when the person is distracted.\u00a0Electromyography (EMG) may be used to measure bursts of electrical activity from the brain and/or spinal cord to a peripheral nerve root (found in the arms and legs) that controls muscles during contraction and at rest.\u00a0Electroencephalography (EEG) can correlate the movement and detect any changes in electrical activity patterns produced by the brain.\u00a0Physicians also look for marked improvement in symptoms following psychotherapy, use of a placebo (a medicine with no specific pharmacological benefit for the disorder being treated but given to see if it produces psychological or physical benefits), or suggestion.\n                \nA multi-therapy approach to treating psychogenic movement includes psychotherapy, placebo, or suggestion; antidepressants for symptoms related to depression or anxiety; cognitive-behavioral therapy to identify and alter thoughts and feelings that may be causing the psychological illness; physical therapy;\u00a0 and rehabilitative and occupational therapy to improve performance of activities of daily living.\u00a0 An experimental treatment is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which can alter electrical activity in the brain\u2019s cortex (the region that controls movement) and may reduce movement frequency."

Highly advanced brain imaging will detect changes in structures of the brain and the strength of fiber connections between certain brain areas.\u00a0 Findings in patients with psychogenic movement disorders will be compared to those of healthy volunteers.\n                \nFunctional magnetic imaging (fMRI) can detect altered blood flow that may reflect changes in activity between brain cells and is being investigated in patients with psychogenic movements.\n                \nOther researchers are exploring the role of biofeedback in lessening or stopping movement symptoms, and how different types of psychotherapy may help individuals who have somatoform disorders.\n                \nAnother study is evaluating the effects in functional status in individuals with psychogenic gait disorder after three weeks of cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation.\u00a0 Follow-up studies after 1 and 12 months will evaluate if any improvement is still present."
