                    "answer": "Holmes-Adie syndrome (HAS) is a neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye and the autonomic nervous system.\u00a0 It is characterized by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light\u00a0 (tonic pupil), along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon.\u00a0\u00a0 HAS is thought to be the result of a neurotrophic (acting on neurons, or nerve cells) viral infection that causes inflammation and damage to neurons in the ciliary ganglion, an area of the brain that controls eye movements, and the dorsal root ganglion, an area of the spinal cord involved in the response of the autonomic nervous system.\u00a0 HAS begins gradually in one eye, and often progresses to involve the other eye.\u00a0 At first, it may only cause the loss of deep tendon reflexes on one side of the body, but then progress to the other side.\u00a0 The eye and reflex symptoms may not appear at the same time.\u00a0 People with HAS may also sweat excessively, sometimes only on one side of the body.\u00a0 The combination of these 3 symptoms \u2013 abnormal pupil size, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and excessive sweating \u2013 is usually called Ross\u2019s syndrome, although some doctors will still diagnose the condition as a variant of HAS.\u00a0 Some individuals will also have cardiovascular abnormalities.\u00a0 The HAS symptoms can appear on their own, or in association with other diseases of the nervous system, such as Sjogren\u2019s syndrome or migraine.\u00a0 It is most often seen in young women.\u00a0 It is rarely an inherited condition."

                    "answer": "Doctors may prescribe reading glasses to compensate for impaired vision in the affected eye, and pilocarpine drops to be applied 3 times daily to constrict the dilated pupil.\u00a0\u00a0 Thoracic sympathectomy, which severs the involved sympathetic nerve, is the definitive treatment for excessive sweating."
