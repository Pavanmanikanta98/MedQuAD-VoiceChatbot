                "Answer": "Warts are growths on your skin caused by an infection with humanpapilloma virus, or HPV. Types of warts include        - Common warts, which often appear on your fingers     - Plantar warts, which show up on the soles of your feet     - Genital warts, which are a sexually transmitted disease     - Flat warts, which appear in places you shave frequently        In children, warts often go away on their own. In adults, they tend to stay. If they hurt or bother you, or if they multiply, you can remove them. Chemical skin treatments usually work. If not, various freezing, surgical and laser treatments can remove warts."
