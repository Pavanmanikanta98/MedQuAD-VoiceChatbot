                "Answer": "Summary : Eye wear protects or corrects your vision. Examples are       - Sunglasses    - Safety goggles    - Glasses (also called eyeglasses)    - Contact lenses       If you need corrective lenses, you may be able to choose between contacts or glasses. Either usually requires a prescription. Almost anyone can wear glasses. Contact lenses require more careful handling.     Many jobs and some sports carry a risk of eye injury. Thousands of children and adults get eye injuries every year. Most are preventable with proper eye protection. Everyone is at risk for eye damage from the sun year-round. It's important to regularly use sunglasses that block out at least 99 percent of UV rays."
