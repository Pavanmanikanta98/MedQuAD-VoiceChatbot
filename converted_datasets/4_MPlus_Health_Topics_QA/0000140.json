                "Answer": "Campylobacter infection is a common foodborne illness. You get it from eating raw or undercooked poultry. You can also get it from coming in contact with contaminated packages of poultry. Symptoms include        - Diarrhea    - Cramping    - Abdominal pain    - Fever     - Nausea and vomiting       Some infected people don't have any symptoms. The illness usually lasts one week. Most people get better without treatment. You should drink extra fluids for as long as the diarrhea lasts. Your doctor will decide whether you need to take antibiotics.     To prevent campylobacter infection, cook poultry thoroughly. Use a separate cutting board and utensils for meats and clean them carefully with soap and hot water after use.
