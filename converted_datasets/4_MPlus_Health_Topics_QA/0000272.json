                "Answer": "Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.     Type 1 diabetes happens most often in children and young adults but can appear at any age. Symptoms may include       -  Being very thirsty     -  Urinating often     -  Feeling very hungry or tired     -  Losing weight without trying     -  Having sores that heal slowly     -  Having dry, itchy skin     -  Losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet     -  Having blurry eyesight        A blood test can show if you have diabetes. If you do, you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. A blood test called the A1C can check to see how well you are managing your diabetes.
