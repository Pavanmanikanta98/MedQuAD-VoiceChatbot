                "Answer": "Summary : Exercise and physical activity are good for just about everyone, including older adults. There are four main types and each type is different. Doing them all will give you more benefits.       - Endurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, and biking are examples.    - Strength exercises make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights or using a resistance band can build strength.    - Balance exercises help prevent falls    - Flexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber       NIH: National Institute on Aging"
