                "Answer": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. It is also a major cause of disability. The risk of heart disease increases as you age. You have a greater risk of heart disease if you are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55. You also are at greater risk if you have a close family member who had heart disease at an early age.     Fortunately, there are many things you can do reduce your chances of getting heart disease. You should        -  Know your blood pressure and keep it under control    -  Exercise regularly     -  Don't smoke     -  Get tested for diabetes and if you have it, keep it under control    -  Know your cholesterol and triglyceride levels and keep them under control    -  Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables     -  Maintain a healthy weight"
