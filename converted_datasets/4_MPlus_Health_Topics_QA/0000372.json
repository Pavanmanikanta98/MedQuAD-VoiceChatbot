                "Answer": "Summary : Folic acid is a B vitamin. It helps the body make healthy new cells. Everyone needs folic acid. For women who may get pregnant, it is really important. Getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy can prevent major birth defects of her baby's brain or spine.     Foods with folic acid in them include       - Leafy green vegetables    - Fruits    - Dried beans, peas, and nuts    - Enriched breads, cereals and other grain products       If you don't get enough folic acid from the foods you eat, you can also take it as a dietary supplement.
