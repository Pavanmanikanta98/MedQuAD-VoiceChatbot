It is the sixth most common type of cancer in the United States.    Symptoms include       - Blood in your urine    - A frequent urge to urinate    - Pain when you urinate    - Low back pain       Risk factors for developing bladder cancer include smoking and exposure to certain chemicals in the workplace. People with a family history of bladder cancer or who are older, white, or male have a higher risk.
