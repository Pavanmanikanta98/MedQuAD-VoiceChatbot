If you don't, you could have problems with your teeth and gums - like cavities or even tooth loss.     Here's how to keep your mouth and teeth healthy:       - Brush your teeth every day with a fluoride toothpaste    - Clean between your teeth every day with floss or another type of between-the-teeth cleaner    - Snack smart - limit sugary snacks    - Don't smoke or chew tobacco    - See your dentist or oral health professional regularly       NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research"
