                "Answer": "In the United States, 1 in 4 women dies from heart disease. The most common cause of heart disease in both men and women is narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart itself. This is called coronary artery disease, and it happens slowly over time. It's the major reason people have heart attacks.    Heart diseases that affect women more than men include       - Coronary microvascular disease (MVD) - a problem that affects the heart's tiny arteries    - Broken heart syndrome - extreme emotional stress leading to severe but often short-term heart muscle failure       The older a woman gets, the more likely she is to get heart disease. But women of all ages should be concerned about heart disease. All women can take steps to prevent it by practicing healthy lifestyle habits.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
