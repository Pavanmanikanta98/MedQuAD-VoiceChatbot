                "Answer": "Summary : A metabolic panel is a group of tests that measures different chemicals in the blood. These tests are usually done on the fluid (plasma) part of blood. The tests provide information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. They can give doctors information about your muscles (including the heart), bones, and organs, such as the kidneys and liver.     There are two types: basic metabolic panel (BMP) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). The BMP checks your blood sugar, calcium, and electrolytes. The BMP also has tests such as creatinine to check your kidney function. The CMP includes all of those tests, as well as tests of your cholesterol, protein levels, and liver function.    You probably need to fast (not eat any food) before the test. Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for the test you are having."
