                "Answer": "Summary : You've probably seen your chart at your doctor's office. In fact, you may have charts at several doctors' offices. If you've been in the hospital, you have a chart there, too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic. To keep track of all this information, it's a good idea to keep your own personal health record.     What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could start with       -  Your name, birth date, blood type, and emergency contact information    -  Date of last physical    -  Dates and results of tests and screenings    -  Major illnesses and surgeries, with dates    -  A list of your medicines and supplements, the dosages, and how long you've taken them    -  Any allergies    -  Any chronic diseases    -  Any history of illnesses in your family"
