                "Answer": "Itching is skin tingling or irritation that makes you want to scratch the itchy area. It's a symptom of many health conditions. Common causes are        -  Allergic reactions    -  Eczema    -  Dry skin    -  Insect bites and stings    -  Irritating chemicals    -  Parasites such as pinworms, scabies, head and body lice    -  Pregnancy    -  Rashes    -  Reactions to medicines       To soothe itchy skin, you can try cold compresses, lotions and lukewarm baths. Avoid scratching, wearing irritating fabrics and high heat and humidity. Most itching is not serious. However, if you itch all over, have hives that keep coming back or have itching without an apparent cause, you might require medical attention."
