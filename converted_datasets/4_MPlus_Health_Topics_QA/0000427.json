Which exams and screenings you need depends on your age, health and family history, and lifestyle choices such as what you eat, how active you are, and whether you smoke.    To make the most of your next check-up, here are some things to do before you go:       - Review your family health history    - Find out if you are due for any general screenings or vaccinations    - Write down a list of issues and questions to take with you       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
