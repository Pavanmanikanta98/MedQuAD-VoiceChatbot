                "Answer": "Sneezing, sore throat, a stuffy nose, coughing - everyone knows the symptoms of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. In the course of a year, people in the United States suffer 1 billion colds.    You can get a cold by touching your eyes or nose after you touch surfaces with cold germs on them. You can also inhale the germs. Symptoms usually begin 2 or 3 days after infection and last 2 to 14 days. Washing your hands and staying away from people with colds will help you avoid colds.     There is no cure for the common cold. For relief, try       -  Getting plenty of rest     -  Drinking fluids    -  Gargling with warm salt water     -  Using cough drops or throat sprays    -  Taking over-the-counter pain or cold medicines       However, do not give aspirin to children. And do not give cough medicine to children under four.     NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"
