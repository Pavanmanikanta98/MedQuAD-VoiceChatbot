                "Answer": "Neuroblastoma is a cancer that forms in your nerve tissue. It usually begins in the adrenal glands, which sit atop your kidneys. It may also begin in your neck, chest or spinal cord. The cancer often begins in early childhood. Sometimes it begins before a child is born. By the time doctors find the cancer, it has usually spread to other parts of the body. The most common symptoms are       -  A lump in the abdomen, neck or chest    -  Bulging eyes    -  Dark circles around the eyes    -  Bone pain    -  Swollen stomach and trouble breathing in babies    -  Painless, bluish lumps under the skin in babies    -  Inability to move a body part       Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or a combination. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Sometimes before giving treatment, doctors wait to see whether symptoms get worse. This is called watchful waiting.
