                "Answer": "Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. They help fight off infections and play a role in your body's immune response. They can also build up and cause inflammation.    Normally your blood doesn't have a large number of eosinophils. Your body may produce more of them in response to       - Allergic disorders    - Skin conditions    - Parasitic and fungal infections    - Autoimmune diseases    - Some cancers    - Bone marrow disorders       In some conditions, the eosinophils can move outside the bloodstream and build up in organs and tissues. Treatment of the problem depends on the cause."
