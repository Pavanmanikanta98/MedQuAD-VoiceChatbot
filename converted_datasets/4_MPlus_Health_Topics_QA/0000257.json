                "Answer": "Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities, such as balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. Many of these diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism, a tumor, or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins, chemicals, and viruses. Sometimes the cause is not known.    Degenerative nerve diseases include       -  Alzheimer's disease    -  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis    - Friedreich's ataxia    -  Huntington's disease    -  Lewy body disease    - Parkinson's disease     -  Spinal muscular atrophy       Degenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening.
