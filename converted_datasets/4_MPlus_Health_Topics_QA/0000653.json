                "Answer": "Summary : Food provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. Nutrients include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.     Healthy eating is not hard. The key is to       -  Eat a variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products    -  Eat lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and low-fat dairy products     -  Drink lots of water    -  Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, saturated fat, and trans fat in your diet       Saturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods, margarines, and shortenings.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
