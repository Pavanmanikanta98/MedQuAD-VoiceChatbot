                "Answer": "If you are pregnant, an infection can be more than just a problem for you. Some infections can be dangerous to your baby. You can help yourself avoid infections:       - Don't eat raw or undercooked meat    - Don't share food or drinks with other people    - Wash your hands frequently    - Don't empty cat litter. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis.       You may need to take medicines or get a vaccine to prevent an infection in your baby. For example, you may need to take antibiotics if you develop an infection with group B strep, or take medicines if you have genital herpes. Only some medicines and vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Ask your health care provider about how best to protect you and your baby."
