                "Answer": "Muscle cramps are sudden, involuntary contractions or spasms in one or more of your muscles. They often occur after exercise or at night, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. It is a very common muscle problem.     Muscle cramps can be caused by nerves that malfunction. Sometimes this malfunction is due to a health problem, such as a spinal cord injury or a pinched nerve in the neck or back. Other causes are       - Straining or overusing a muscle    - Dehydration    - A lack of minerals in your diet or the depletion of minerals in your body    - Not enough blood getting to your muscles       Cramps can be very painful. Stretching or gently massaging the muscle can relieve this pain."
