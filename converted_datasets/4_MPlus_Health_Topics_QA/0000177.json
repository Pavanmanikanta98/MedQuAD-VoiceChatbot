                "Answer": "Summary : Children's healthy development depends on safe and positive experiences when they are very young. If you work or go to school, you want to know that your child is in good hands while you are away. You may choose in-home care, where the caregiver comes to your home. Or your child might go to the caregiver's home. Finally, there are child care centers. You need to choose the one that works for your family.     It is important to get to know your child's caregivers. They will be a big part of your child's life. The caregiver's training should involve       - Knowledge of how young children learn and grow    - Positive, consistent discipline    - Knowledge of the signs that a child is sick    - Cleanliness and safety practices to help keep kids from getting sick or hurt    - Basic first aid"
