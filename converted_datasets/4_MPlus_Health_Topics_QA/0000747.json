They commonly form where your bones are close to your skin, such as your ankles, back, elbows, heels and hips. You are at risk if you are bedridden, use a wheelchair, or are unable to change your position. Pressure sores can cause serious infections, some of which are life-threatening. They can be a problem for people in nursing homes.    You can prevent the sores by        -  Keeping skin clean and dry    - Changing position every two hours    -  Using pillows and products that relieve pressure       Pressure sores have a variety of treatments.
