When there is something wrong with them, you may not be able to do your regular activities.     Hand problems include        -  Carpal tunnel syndrome - compression of a nerve as it goes through the wrist, often making your fingers feel numb     - Injuries that result in fractures, ruptured ligaments and dislocations     -  Osteoarthritis - wear-and-tear arthritis, which can also cause deformity     -  Tendinitis - irritation of the tendons     - Disorders and injuries of your fingers and thumb"
