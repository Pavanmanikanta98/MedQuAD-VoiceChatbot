                "Answer": "Most teenage girls don't plan to get pregnant, but many do. Teen pregnancies carry extra health risks to both the mother and the baby. Often, teens don't get prenatal care soon enough, which can lead to problems later on. They have a higher risk for pregnancy-related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby include premature birth and a low birth weight.    If you're a pregnant teen, you can help yourself and your baby by       - Getting regular prenatal care    - Taking your prenatal vitamins for your health and to prevent some birth defects    - Avoiding smoking, alcohol, and drugs    - Using a condom, if you are having sex, to prevent sexually transmitted diseases that could hurt your baby"
