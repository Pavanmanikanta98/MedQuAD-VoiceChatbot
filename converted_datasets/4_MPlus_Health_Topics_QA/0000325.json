                "Answer": "Summary : Planning for the end of life can be difficult. But by deciding what end-of-life care best suits your needs when you are healthy, you can help those close to you make the right choices when the time comes.    End-of-life planning usually includes making choices about the following:       - The goals of care (for example, whether to use certain medicines during the last days of life)    - Where you want to spend your final days    - Which treatments for end-of-life care you wish to receive    - What type of palliative care and hospice care you wish to receive       Advance directives can help make your wishes clear to your family and health care providers."
