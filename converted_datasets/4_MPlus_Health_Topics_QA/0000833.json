                "Answer": "Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your windpipe and larynx (also called the voice box). The technical name for the throat is pharynx.    You can have a sore throat for many reasons. Often, colds and flu cause sore throats. Other causes can include:       - Allergies    - Mononucleosis    - Smoking    - Strep throat    - Tonsillitis - an infection in the tonsils       Treatment depends on the cause. Sucking on lozenges, drinking lots of liquids, and gargling may ease the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also help, but children should not take aspirin."
