                "Answer": "Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. If you have it, you may have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. As a result, you may get too little sleep or have poor-quality sleep. You may not feel refreshed when you wake up.    Symptoms of insomnia include:       - Lying awake for a long time before you fall asleep    -  Sleeping for only short periods    - Being awake for much of the night    - Feeling as if you haven't slept at all    - Waking up too early       Your doctor will diagnose insomnia based on your medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. He or she also may recommend a sleep study. A sleep study measures how well you sleep and how your body responds to sleep problems. Treatments include lifestyle changes, counseling, and medicines.
