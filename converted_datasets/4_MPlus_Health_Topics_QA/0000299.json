                "Answer": "People drown when they get too much water in their lungs. You can drown in as little as an inch or two of water. Babies can drown in a sink or bathtub. Preschoolers are most likely to drown in a swimming pool. People who have seizure disorders are also at risk in the water. Drowning can happen quickly and silently.     Drowning precautions should include       -  Fences around pools    -  Supervising children near any body of water, including tubs    -  Not swimming or boating when under the influence of alcohol or sedatives    -  Wearing life jackets when boating    -  Learning CPR"
