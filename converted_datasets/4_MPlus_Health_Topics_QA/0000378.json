                "Answer": "Each of your feet has 26 bones, 33 joints, and more than 100 tendons, muscles, and ligaments. No wonder a lot of things can go wrong. Here are a few common problems:       - Bunions - hard, painful bumps on the big toe joint    -  Corns and calluses - thickened skin from friction or pressure    -  Plantar warts - warts on the soles of your feet    -  Fallen arches - also called flat feet        Ill-fitting shoes often cause these problems. Aging and being overweight also increase your chances of having foot problems."
