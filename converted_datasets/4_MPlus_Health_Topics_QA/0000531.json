                "Answer": "Your jaw is a set of bones that holds your teeth. It consists of two main parts. The upper part is the maxilla. It doesn't move. The moveable lower part is called the mandible. You move it when you talk or chew. The two halves of the mandible meet at your chin. The joint where the mandible meets your skull is the temporomandibular joint.     Jaw problems include       - Fractures    - Dislocations    - Temporomandibular joint dysfunction    - Osteonecrosis, which happens when your bones lose their blood supply    - Cancers       Treatment of jaw problems depends on the cause."
