                "Answer": "Summary : You can't remove all the safety hazards from your life, but you can reduce them. To avoid many major hazards and prepare for emergencies       -  Keep emergency phone numbers by your telephones    -  Make a first aid kit for your home    -  Make a family emergency plan    -  Install and maintain smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors    -  Keep guns unloaded and locked up. Lock up the ammunition separately.     -  Follow the directions carefully when using tools or equipment       Young children are especially at risk. Supervision is the best way to keep them safe. Childproofing the house can also help."
