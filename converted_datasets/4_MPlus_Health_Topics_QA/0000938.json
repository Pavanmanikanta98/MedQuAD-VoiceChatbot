                "Answer": "Menstruation, or period, is a woman's monthly bleeding. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is different from normal menstrual periods. It could be bleeding that is between periods, lasts several weeks, or happens before puberty or after menopause. Causes can include        - Uterine fibroids or polyps    - Hormone problems    - Hormone pills, such as birth control pills and menopausal hormone therapy    - Cancer of the cervix, ovaries, uterus or vagina    - Thyroid problems        Bleeding during pregnancy can have several different causes. It is not always a serious problem, but to be safe you should always contact your healthcare provider.      Pelvic exams, blood tests and other procedures can help your healthcare provider diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause."
