                "Answer": "Your peritoneum is the tissue that lines your abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in your abdomen. A liquid, peritoneal fluid, lubricates the surface of this tissue.    Disorders of the peritoneum are not common. They include       - Peritonitis - an inflammation of the peritoneum    - Cancer    - Complications from peritoneal dialysis       Your doctor may use imaging tests or lab tests to analyze the peritoneal fluid to diagnose the problem. Treatment of peritoneal disorders depends on the cause."
