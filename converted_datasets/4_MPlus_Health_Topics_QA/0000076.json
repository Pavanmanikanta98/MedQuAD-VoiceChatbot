                "Answer": "Summary : There are many new responsibilities when you have a baby. One of them is to make sure they get the checkups that they need. Well-baby exams are important in making sure that your baby is growing and developing properly. If there are problems, you can catch them early. This means that there is a better chance for treatment.    During these checkups, your baby will get any needed immunizations and screenings. This is also a good chance to ask your health care provider any questions about how to care for your baby."
