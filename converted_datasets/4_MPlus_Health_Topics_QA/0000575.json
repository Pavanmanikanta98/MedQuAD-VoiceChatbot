Causes of malabsorption syndromes include       - Celiac disease    - Lactose intolerance    - Short bowel syndrome. This happens after surgery to remove half or more of the small intestine. You might need the surgery if you have a problem with the small intestine from a disease, injury, or birth defect.    - Whipple disease, a rare bacterial infection    - Genetic diseases    - Certain medicines       Symptoms of different malabsorption syndromes can vary. They often include chronic diarrhea, abnormal stools, weight loss, and gas. Your doctor may use lab, imaging, or other tests to make a diagnosis.    Treatment of malabsorption syndromes depends on the cause."
