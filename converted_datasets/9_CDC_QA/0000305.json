These include:\n    \n     - Diabetes\n     - Cancer\n     - HIV/AIDS\n     - Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (an illness that causes the air sacs of the lungs to become plugged)\n     - Connective tissue disorder (a disease that affects the tissue that connects and supports different parts of the body)\n     - Alcoholism\n     - Having a bone marrow or solid organ transplant\n     - Taking high doses of drugs called corticosteroids\n    \n    \nIn the United States, it has been estimated that 500-1,000 new cases of nocardiosis infection occur every year. Approximately 60% of nocardiosis cases are associated with pre-existing immune compromise. \n    \nIn addition, men have a greater risk of getting the infection than women; for every female who gets sick with nocardiosis, there are about 3 males who get the disease."

If your lungs are infected, you can experience:\n    \n     - Fever\n     - Weight loss\n     - Night sweats\n     - Cough\n     - Chest pain\n     - Pneumonia\n    \n    \nWhen lung infections occur, the infection commonly spreads to the brain. If your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) is infected, you can experience:\n    \n     - Headache\n     - Weakness\n     - Confusion\n     - Seizures (sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain)\n    \n    \nSkin infections can occur when open wounds or cuts come into contact with contaminated soil. If your skin is affected, you can experience:\n    \n     - Ulcers\n     - Nodules sometimes draining and spreading along lymph nodes"

Tissue samples may include the:\n    \n     - Brain\n     - Skin\n     - Lungs (or other parts of the lower airways)\n     - Mucus from the lower airways"
