It is found in association with poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and in places where human feces are used as fertilizer.\n    Geographic Distribution\n    \nThe geographic distributions of Ascaris are worldwide in areas with warm, moist climates and are widely overlapping. Infection occurs worldwide and is most common in tropical and subtropical areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor."

Infections are generally treated for 1-3 days. The drugs are effective and appear to have few side effects.\n    \nMore on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment"
