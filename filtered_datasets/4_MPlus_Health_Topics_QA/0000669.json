        "answer": "Osteoporosis makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but it is common in older women. As many as half of all women and a quarter of men older than 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis.    Risk factors include        -  Getting older     -  Being small and thin     -  Having a family history of osteoporosis    -  Taking certain medicines    -  Being a white or Asian woman    -  Having osteopenia, which is low bone density       Osteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health. To keep bones strong, eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, exercise and do not smoke. If needed, medicines can also help.
