        "answer": "Summary : Many U.S. households have guns, but they can cause harm if not handled properly. Here are some things you can do to keep yourself and your family safe:       - Teach children that they shouldn't touch guns and that if they see a gun, to leave it alone and tell an adult.     - If your children play at another home, talk to the parents about gun safety.     - Treat every gun as if it were loaded.     - Always store guns unloaded.     - Lock guns in a rack or safe, and hide the keys or combination.     - Store ammunition away from guns and keep it locked.     - Don't keep guns in your home if someone in your family has a mental illness, severe depression, or potential for violence.",
