        "question": "What is (are) Hip Injuries and Disorders ?",
        "answer": "Your hip is the joint where your thigh bone meets your pelvis bone. Hips are called ball-and-socket joints because the ball-like top of your thigh bone moves within a cup-like space in your pelvis. Your hips are very stable. When they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. However, playing sports, running, overuse or falling can all sometimes lead to hip injuries. These include        -  Strains    -  Bursitis    -  Dislocations    -  Fractures       Certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain and limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of these are common in older people.     Treatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement.",
