        "question": "What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?",
        "answer": "Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.     Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of       - 119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure    - 140/90 or higher is high blood pressure    - Between 120 and 139 for the top number, or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure, unless you take steps to prevent it.       High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, but it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack and kidney failure.    You can control high blood pressure through healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise and the DASH diet and taking medicines, if needed.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",
