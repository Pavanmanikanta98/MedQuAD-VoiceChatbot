Acute leukemia is a fast growing type while chronic leukemia grows slowly. Children with leukemia usually have one of the acute types.     Symptoms include       - Infections    - Fever    - Loss of appetite    - Tiredness    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Swollen lymph nodes    - Night sweats    - Shortness of breath    - Pain in the bones or joints       Risk factors for childhood leukemia include having a brother or sister with leukemia, having certain genetic disorders and having had radiation or chemotherapy.
