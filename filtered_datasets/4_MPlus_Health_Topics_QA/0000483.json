Symptoms include       - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin     - Fever and chills     - Night sweats     - Weight loss     - Loss of appetite     - Itchy skin       To diagnose Hodgkin disease, doctors use a physical exam and history, blood tests, and a biopsy.

In most cases, Hodgkin disease can be cured.     NIH: National Cancer Institute",
