        "answer": "Regular health exams and tests can help find problems before they start. They also can help find problems early, when your chances for treatment are better. As a woman, you need some special exams and screenings. During your checkup, your health care provider will usually do:       - A pelvic exam - an exam to check if internal female organs are normal by feeling their shape and size.    - A Pap test - a test to check for cancer of the cervix, the opening to a woman's uterus. Cells from the cervix are examined under a microscope.    - A clinical breast exam - to check for breast cancer by feeling and looking at your breasts.       Your health care provider may also recommend other tests, including a mammogram or a test for HPV.",
