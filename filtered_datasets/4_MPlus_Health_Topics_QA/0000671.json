        "question": "What is (are) Ovarian Cancer ?",
        "answer": "The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce a woman's eggs and female hormones. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.    Cancer of the ovary is not common, but it causes more deaths than other female reproductive cancers. The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated, the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early. Women with ovarian cancer may have no symptoms or just mild symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage. Then it is hard to treat. Symptoms may include       - A heavy feeling in the pelvis    - Pain in the lower abdomen    -  Bleeding from the vagina    -  Weight gain or loss    -  Abnormal periods    -  Unexplained back pain that gets worse    -  Gas, nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite       To diagnose ovarian cancer, doctors do one or more tests. They include a physical exam, a pelvic exam, lab tests, ultrasound, or a biopsy. Treatment is usually surgery followed by chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute",
