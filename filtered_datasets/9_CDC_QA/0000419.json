        "question": "What are the symptoms of Typhoid Fever ?",
        "answer": "Persons with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103\u00b0 to 104\u00b0 F (39\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 C). They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite. In some cases, patients have a rash of flat, rose-colored spots. The only way to know for sure if an illness is typhoid fever is to have samples of stool or blood tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi.\n\nTyphoid fever\u2019s danger doesn\u2019t end when symptoms disappear: \n\nEven if your symptoms seem to go away, you may still be carrying Salmonella Typhi. If so, the illness could return, or you could pass the disease to other people. In fact, if you work at a job where you handle food or care for small children, you may be barred legally from going back to work until a doctor has determined that you no longer carry any typhoid bacteria.\n                \nIf you are being treated for typhoid fever, it is important to do the following:\n                \nKeep taking the prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has asked you to take them.\n                \nWash your hands carefully with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people. This will lower the chance that you will pass the infection on to someone else.\n                \nHave your doctor perform a series of stool cultures to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in your body.",
