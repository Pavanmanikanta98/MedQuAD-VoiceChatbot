        "question": "What is (are) Heart Failure ?",
        "answer": "Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In some cases, the heart can't fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can't pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems.\n                \nThe term \"heart failure\" doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHeart failure develops over time as the heart's pumping action grows weaker. The condition can affect the right side of the heart only, or it can affect both sides of the heart. Most cases involve both sides of the heart.\n                \nRight-side heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Left-side heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\n                \nRight-side heart failure may cause fluid to build up in the feet, ankles, legs, liver, abdomen, and the veins in the neck. Right-side and left-side heart failure also may cause shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness).\n                \nThe leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart. Examples include coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nHeart failure is a very common condition. About 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure.Both children and adults can have the condition, although the symptoms and treatments differ. The Health Topicfocuses on heart failure in adults.\n                \nCurrently, heart failure has no cure. However, treatmentssuch as medicines and lifestyle changescan help people who have the condition live longer and more active lives. Researchers continue to study new ways to treat heart failure and its complications.",

        "question": "What causes Heart Failure ?",
        "answer": "Conditions that damage or overwork the heart muscle can cause heart failure. Over time, the heart weakens. It isnt able to fill with and/or pump blood as well as it should. As the heart weakens, certain proteins and substances might be released into the blood. These substances have a toxic effect on the heart and blood flow, and they worsen heart failure.\n                \nCauses of heart failure include:\n                \nCoronary heart disease\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nOther heart conditions or diseases\n                \nOther factors\n                \n\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nCoronary heart disease is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.\n                \nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. Coronary heart disease can lead to chest pain or discomfort calledangina, aheart attack, and heart damage.\n                \n\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the bodys blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. The body normally breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nIn diabetes, the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage and weaken the heart muscle and the blood vessels around the heart, leading to heart failure.\n                \n\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can weaken your heart and lead to plaque buildup.\n                \nBlood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.\n                \n\n                \nOther Heart Conditions or Diseases\n                \nOther conditions and diseases also can lead to heart failure, such as:\n                \nArrhythmia. Happens when a problem occurs with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nCardiomyopathy.Happens when the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid.\n                \nCongenital heart defects. Problems with the hearts structure are present at birth.\n                \nHeart valve disease. Occurs if one or more of your heart valves doesnt work properly, which can be present at birth or caused by infection, other heart conditions, and age.\n                \n\n                \nOther Factors\n                \nOther factors also can injure the heart muscle and lead to heart failure. Examples include:\n                \nAlcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use\n                \nHIV/AIDS\n                \nThyroid disorders (having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body)\n                \nToo much vitamin E\n                \nTreatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy",

        "question": "Who is at risk for Heart Failure? ?",
        "answer": "About 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure. The number of people who have this condition is growing.\n                \nHeart failure is more common in:\n                \nPeople who are age 65 or older. Aging can weaken the heart muscle. Older people also may have had diseases for many years that led to heart failure. Heart failure is a leading cause of hospital stays among people on Medicare.\n                \nBlacks are more likely to have heart failure than people of other races. Theyre also more likely to have symptoms at a younger age, have more hospital visits due to heart failure, and die from heart failure.\n                \nPeople who areoverweight. Excess weight puts strain on the heart. Being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2diabetes. These diseases can lead to heart failure.\n                \nPeople who have had a heart attack. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack and can weaken the heart muscle.\n                \nChildren who havecongenital heart defectsalso can develop heart failure. These defects occur if the heart, heart valves, or blood vessels near the heart dont form correctly while a baby is in the womb. Congenital heart defects can make the heart work harder. This weakens the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure. Children dont have the same symptoms of heart failure or get the same treatments as adults.

When symptoms start, you may feel tired and short of breath after routine physical effort, like climbing stairs.\n                \nAs your heart grows weaker, symptoms get worse. You may begin to feel tired and short of breath after getting dressed or walking across the room. Some people have shortness of breath while lying flat.\n                \nFluid buildup from heart failure also causes weight gain, frequent urination, and a cough that's worse at night and when you're lying down. This cough may be a sign of acute pulmonary edema (e-DE-ma). This is a condition in which too much fluid builds up in your lungs.

        "question": "How to diagnose Heart Failure ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose heart failure based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. The signs and symptoms of heart failure also are common in other conditions. Thus, your doctor will:\n                \nFind out whether you have a disease or condition that can cause heart failure, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, or diabetes\n                \nRule out other causes of your symptoms\n                \nFind any damage to your heart and check how well your heart pumps blood\n                \nEarly diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer, more active lives.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor will ask whether you or others in your family have or have had a disease or condition that can cause heart failure.\n                \nYour doctor also will ask about your symptoms. He or she will want to know which symptoms you have, when they occur, how long you've had them, and how severe they are. Your answers will help show whether and how much your symptoms limit your daily routine.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will:\n                \nListen to your heart for sounds that aren't normal\n                \nListen to your lungs for the sounds of extra fluid buildup\n                \nLook for swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and the veins in your neck\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nNo single test can diagnose heart failure. If you have signs and symptoms of heart failure, your doctor may recommend one or more tests.\n                \nYour doctor also may refer you to a cardiologist. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nAn EKG may show whether the walls in your heart's pumping chambers are thicker than normal. Thicker walls can make it harder for your heart to pump blood. An EKG also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x raytakes pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged, you have fluid in your lungs, or you have lung disease.\n                \nBNP Blood Test\n                \nThis test checks the level of a hormone in your blood called BNP. The level of this hormone rises during heart failure.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves work.\n                \nEcho also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and heart muscle damage caused by lack of blood flow.\n                \nEcho might be done before and after a stress test (see below). A stress echo can show how well blood is flowing through your heart. The test also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nDoppler Ultrasound\n                \nA Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure the speed and direction of blood flow. This test often is done with echo to give a more complete picture of blood flow to the heart and lungs.\n                \nDoctors often use Doppler ultrasound to help diagnose right-side heart failure.\n                \nHolter Monitor\n                \nA Holter monitor records your heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period, while you go about your normal daily routine.\n                \nYou wear small patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck.\n                \nNuclear Heart Scan\n                \nA nuclear heart scan shows how well blood is flowing through your heart and how much blood is reaching your heart muscle.\n                \nDuring a nuclear heart scan, a safe, radioactive substance called a tracer is injected into your bloodstream through a vein. The tracer travels to your heart and releases energy. Special cameras outside of your body detect the energy and use it to create pictures of your heart.\n                \nA nuclear heart scan can show where the heart muscle is healthy and where it's damaged.\n                \nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a type of nuclear heart scan. It shows the level of chemical activity in areas of your heart. This test can help your doctor see whether enough blood is flowing to these areas. A PET scan can show blood flow problems that other tests might not detect.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun), a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. This allows your doctor to look inside your coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nDuring this procedure, your doctor can check the pressure and blood flow in your heart chambers, collect blood samples, and use x rays to look at your coronary arteries.\n                \nCoronary Angiography\n                \nCoronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) usually is done with cardiac catheterization. A dye that can be seen on x ray is injected into your bloodstream through the tip of the catheter.\n                \nThe dye allows your doctor to see the flow of blood to your heart muscle. Angiography also shows how well your heart is pumping.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast.\n                \nYou may walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.\n                \nHeart tests, such as nuclear heart scanning and echo, often are done during stress testing.\n                \nCardiac MRI\n                \nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it's beating. The test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels.\n                \nA cardiac MRI can show whether parts of your heart are damaged. Doctors also have used MRI in research studies to find early signs of heart failure, even before symptoms appear.\n                \nThyroid Function Tests\n                \nThyroid function tests show how well your thyroid gland is working. These tests include blood tests, imaging tests, and tests to stimulate the thyroid. Having too much or too little thyroid hormone in the blood can lead to heart failure.",

        "answer": "Early diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer, more active lives. Treatment for heart failure depends on the type and severity of the heart failure.\n                \nThe goals of treatment for all stages of heart failure include:\n                \nTreating the conditions underlying cause, such ascoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, ordiabetes\n                \nReducing symptoms\n                \nStopping the heart failure from getting worse\n                \nIncreasing your lifespan and improving your quality of life\n                \nTreatments usually include lifestyle changes, medicines, and ongoing care. If you have severe heart failure, you also may need medical procedures or surgery.\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have heart failure. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nIf you eat:\n                \nTry to eat no more than:\n                \n1,200 calories a day                \n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day      \n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterollevels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nYou should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nLiquid Intake\n                \nIts important for people who have heart failure to take in the correct amounts and types of liquids. Consuming too much liquid can worsen heart failure. Also, if you have heart failure, you shouldnt drink alcohol. Talk with your doctor about what amounts and types of liquids you should have each day.\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart failure and coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week.

They also may reduce the risk of a futureheart attack.\n                \nAldosterone antagonists trigger the body to remove excess sodium through urine.

You may need a medical procedure or surgery.\n                \nIn heart failure, the right and left sides of the heart may no longer contract at the same time. This disrupts the hearts pumping. To correct this problem, your doctor might implant a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (a type ofpacemaker) near your heart. This device helps both sides of your heart contract at the same time, which can decrease heart failure symptoms.\n                \nSome people who have heart failure have very rapid, irregular heartbeats. Without treatment, these heartbeats can causesudden cardiac arrest. Your doctor might implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) near your heart to solve this problem. An ICD checks your heart rate and uses electrical pulses to correct irregular heart rhythms.\n                \nPeople who have severe heart failure symptoms at rest, despite other treatments, may need:\n                \nA mechanical heart pump, such as aleft ventricular assist device. This device helps pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. You may use a heart pump until you have surgery or as a long-term treatment.\n                \nHeart transplant. A heart transplant is an operation in which a persons diseased heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased donor.
