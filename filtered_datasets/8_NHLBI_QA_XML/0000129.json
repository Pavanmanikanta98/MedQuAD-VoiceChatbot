        "question": "What is (are) Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?",
        "answer": "Thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah) and thrombocytosis (THROM-bo-si-TO-sis) are conditions in which your blood has a higher than normal number of platelets (PLATE-lets).\n                \nPlatelets are blood cell fragments. They're made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells.\n                \nPlatelets travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot). Clotting helps stop any bleeding that may occur if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a blood clot also is called a thrombus.\n                \nA normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe term \"thrombocythemia\" is preferred when the cause of a high platelet count isn't known. The condition sometimes is called primary or essential thrombocythemia.\n                \nThis condition occurs if faulty cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. What causes the bone marrow to make too many platelets often isn't known.\n                \nWith primary thrombocythemia, a high platelet count may occur alone or with other blood cell disorders. This condition isn't common.\n                \nWhen another disease or condition causes a high platelet count, the term \"thrombocytosis\" is preferred. This condition often is called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Secondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia.\n                \nOften, a high platelet count doesn't cause signs or symptoms. Rarely, serious or life-threatening symptoms can develop, such as blood clots and bleeding. These symptoms are more likely to occur in people who have primary thrombocythemia.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPeople who have primary thrombocythemia with no signs or symptoms don't need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable.\n                \nOther people who have this condition may need medicines or procedures to treat it. Most people who have primary thrombocythemia will live a normal lifespan.\n                \nTreatment and outlook for secondary thrombocytosis depend on its underlying cause.",

        "question": "What causes Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?",
        "answer": "Primary Thrombocythemia\n                \nIn this condition, faulty stem cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. What causes this to happen usually isn't known. When this process occurs without other blood cell disorders, it's called essential thrombocythemia.\n                \nA rare form of thrombocythemia is inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through the genes.) In some cases, a genetic mutation may cause the condition.\n                \nIn addition to the bone marrow making too many platelets, the platelets also are abnormal in primary thrombocythemia. They may form blood clots or, surprisingly, cause bleeding when they don't work well.\n                \nBleeding also can occur because of a condition that develops called von Willebrand disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process.\n                \nAfter many years, scarring of the bone marrow can occur.\n                \nSecondary Thrombocytosis\n                \nThis condition occurs if another disease, condition, or outside factor causes the platelet count to rise. For example, 35 percent of people who have high platelet counts also have cancermostly lung, gastrointestinal, breast, ovarian, and lymphoma. Sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer.\n                \nOther conditions or factors that can cause a high platelet count are:\n                \nIron-deficiency anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)\n                \nHemolytic (HEE-moh-lit-ick) anemia\n                \nAbsence of a spleen (after surgery to remove the organ)\n                \nInflammatory or infectious diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis\n                \nReactions to medicine\n                \nSome conditions can lead to a high platelet count that lasts for only a short time. Examples of such conditions include:\n                \nRecovery from serious blood loss\n                \nRecovery from a very low platelet count caused by excessive alcohol use and lack of vitamin B12 or folate\n                \nAcute (short-term) infection or inflammation\n                \nResponse to physical activity\n                \nAlthough the platelet count is high in secondary thrombocytosis, the platelets are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia). Thus, people who have secondary thrombocytosis have a lower risk of blood clots and bleeding.",

        "answer": "Primary Thrombocythemia\n                \nThrombocythemia isn't common. The exact number of people who have the condition isn't known. Some estimates suggest that 24 out of every 100,000 people have primary thrombocythemia.\n                \nPrimary thrombocythemia is more common in people aged 50 to 70, but it can occur at any age. For unknown reasons, more women around the age of 30 have primary thrombocythemia than men of the same age.\n                \nSecondary Thrombocytosis\n                \nYou might be at risk for secondary thrombocytosis if you have a disease, condition, or factor that can cause it. (For more information, go to \"What Causes Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis?\")\n                \nSecondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia.

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?",
        "answer": "People who have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may not have signs or symptoms. These conditions might be discovered only after routine blood tests.\n                \nHowever, people who have primary thrombocythemia are more likely than those who have secondary thrombocytosis to have serious signs and symptoms.\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of a high platelet count are linked to blood clots and bleeding. They include weakness, bleeding, headache, dizziness, chest pain, and tingling in the hands and feet.\n                \nBlood Clots\n                \nIn primary thrombocythemia, blood clots most often develop in the brain, hands, and feet. But they can develop anywhere in the body, including in the heart and intestines.\n                \nBlood clots in the brain may cause symptoms such as chronic (ongoing) headache and dizziness. In extreme cases, stroke may occur.\n                \nBlood clots in the tiny blood vessels of the hands and feet leave them numb and red. This may lead to an intense burning and throbbing pain felt mainly on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of blood clots may include:\n                \nChanges in speech or awareness, ranging from confusion to passing out\n                \nSeizures\n                \nUpper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or abdomen\n                \nShortness of breath and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\n                \nIn pregnant women, blood clots in the placenta can cause miscarriage or problems with fetal growth and development.\n                \nWomen who have primary thrombocythemia or secondary thrombocytosis and take birth control pills are at increased risk for blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots are related to other conditions and factors as well. Older age, prior blood clots, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking also increase your risk for blood clots.\n                \nBleeding\n                \nIf bleeding occurs, it most often affects people who have platelet counts higher than 1million platelets per microliter of blood. Signs of bleeding include nosebleeds, bruising, bleeding from the mouth or gums, or blood in the stools.\n                \nAlthough bleeding usually is associated with a low platelet count, it also can occur in people who have high platelet counts. Blood clots that develop in thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may use up your body's platelets. This means that not enough platelets are left in your bloodstream to seal off cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls.\n                \nAnother cause of bleeding in people who have very high platelets counts is a condition called von Willebrand Disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process.\n                \nIn rare cases of primary thrombocythemia, the faulty bone marrow cells will cause a form of leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah).

        "question": "How to diagnose Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in blood diseases and conditions.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask you about factors that can affect your platelets, such as:\n                \nAny medical procedures or blood transfusions you've had\n                \nAny recent infections or vaccines you've had\n                \nThe medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines\n                \nYour general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink\n                \nAny family history of high platelet counts\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. He or she also will check for signs of conditions that can cause secondary thrombocytosis, such as an infection.\n                \nPrimary thrombocythemia is diagnosed only after all possible causes of a high platelet count are ruled out. For example, your doctor may recommend tests to check for early, undiagnosed cancer. If another disease, condition, or factor is causing a high platelet count, the diagnosis is secondary thrombocytosis.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a high platelet count.\n                \nComplete Blood Count\n                \nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm.\n                \nIf you have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis, the CBC results will show that your platelet count is high.\n                \nBlood Smear\n                \nA blood smear is used to check the condition of your platelets. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your platelets.\n                \nBone Marrow Tests\n                \nBone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in the bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy.\n                \nBone marrow aspiration might be done to find out whether your bone marrow is making too many platelets. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells.\n                \nA bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow.\n                \nWith thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis, the bone marrow has a higher than normal number of the very large cells that make platelets.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other blood tests to look for genetic factors that can cause a high platelet count.",

        "answer": "Primary Thrombocythemia\n                \nThis condition is considered less harmful today than in the past, and its outlook often is good. People who have no signs or symptoms don't need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable.\n                \nTaking aspirin may help people who are at risk for blood clots (aspirin thins the blood). However, talk with your doctor about using aspirin because it can cause bleeding.\n                \nDoctors prescribe aspirin to most pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia. This is because it doesn't have a high risk of side effects for the fetus.\n                \nSome people who have primary thrombocythemia may need medicines or medical procedures to lower their platelet counts.\n                \nMedicines To Lower Platelet Counts\n                \nYou may need medicines to lower your platelet count if you:\n                \nHave a history of blood clots or bleeding\n                \nHave risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes\n                \nAre older than 60\n                \nHave a platelet count over 1 million\n                \nYou'll need to take these medicines throughout your life.\n                \nHydroxyurea. This platelet-lowering medicine is used to treat cancers and other life-threatening diseases. Hydroxyurea most often is given under the care of doctors who specialize in cancer or blood diseases. Patients on hydroxyurea are closely monitored.\n                \nCurrently, hydroxyurea plus aspirin is the standard treatment for people who have primary thrombocythemia and are at high risk for blood clots.\n                \nAnagrelide. This medicine also has been used to lower platelet counts in people who have thrombocythemia. However, research shows that when compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide has worse outcomes. Anagrelide also has side effects, such as fluid retention, palpitations (pal-pih-TA-shuns), arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), heart failure, and headaches.\n                \nInterferon alfa. This medicine lowers platelet counts, but 20 percent of patients can't handle its side effects. Side effects include a flu-like feeling, decreased appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), diarrhea, seizures, irritability, and sleepiness.\n                \nDoctors may prescribe this medicine to pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia because it's safer for a fetus than hydroxyurea and anagrelide.\n                \nPlateletpheresis\n                \nPlateletpheresis (PLATE-let-fe-REH-sis) is a procedure used to rapidly lower your platelet count. This procedure is used only for emergencies. For example, if you're having a stroke due to primary thrombocythemia, you may need plateletpheresis.\n                \nAn intravenous (IV) needle that's connected to a tube is placed in one of your blood vessels to remove blood. The blood goes through a machine that removes platelets from the blood. The remaining blood is then put back into you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels.\n                \nOne or two procedures might be enough to reduce your platelet count to a safe level.\n                \nSecondary Thrombocytosis\n                \nSecondary thrombocytosis is treated by addressing the condition that's causing it.\n                \nPeople who have secondary thrombocytosis usually don't need platelet-lowering medicines or procedures. This is because their platelets usually are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia).\n                \nAlso, secondary thrombocytosis is less likely than primary thrombocythemia to cause serious problems related to blood clots and bleeding.",
