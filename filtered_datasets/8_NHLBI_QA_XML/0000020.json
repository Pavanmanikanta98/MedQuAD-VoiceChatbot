        "question": "What is (are) Bronchiectasis ?",
        "answer": "Bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis) is a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.\n                \nBronchiectasis usually is the result of an infection or other condition that injures the walls of your airways or prevents the airways from clearing mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance that the airways produce to help remove inhaled dust, bacteria, and other small particles.\n                \nIn bronchiectasis, your airways slowly lose their ability to clear out mucus. When mucus can't be cleared, it builds up and creates an environment in which bacteria can grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections.\n                \nEach infection causes more damage to your airways. Over time, the airways lose their ability to move air in and out. This can prevent enough oxygen from reaching your vital organs.\n                \nBronchiectasis can lead to serious health problems, such as respiratory failure, atelectasis (at-eh-LEK-tah-sis), and heart failure.\n                \nBronchiectasis\n                \n\n                \nOverview\n                \nBronchiectasis can affect just one section of one of your lungs or many sections of both lungs.\n                \nThe initial lung damage that leads to bronchiectasis often begins in childhood. However, symptoms may not occur until months or even years after you start having repeated lung infections.\n                \nIn the United States, common childhood infectionssuch as whooping cough and measlesused to cause many cases of bronchiectasis. However, these causes are now less common because of vaccines and antibiotics.\n                \nNow bronchiectasis usually is due to a medical condition that injures the airway walls or prevents the airways from clearing mucus. Examples of such conditions include cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary (SIL-e-ar-e) dyskinesia (dis-kih-NE-ze-ah), or PCD.\n                \nBronchiectasis that affects only one part of the lung may be caused by a blockage rather than a medical condition.\n                \nBronchiectasis can be congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) or acquired. Congenital bronchiectasis affects infants and children. It's the result of a problem with how the lungs form in a fetus.\n                \nAcquired bronchiectasis occurs as a result of another condition or factor. This type of bronchiectasis can affect adults and older children. Acquired bronchiectasis is more common than the congenital type.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nCurrently, bronchiectasis has no cure. However, with proper care, most people who have it can enjoy a good quality of life.\n                \nEarly diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis are important. The sooner your doctor starts treating bronchiectasis and any underlying conditions, the better your chances of preventing further lung damage.",

        "question": "What causes Bronchiectasis ?",
        "answer": "Damage to the walls of the airways usually is the cause of bronchiectasis. A lung infection may cause this damage. Examples of lung infections that can lead to bronchiectasis include:\n                \nSevere pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah)\n                \nWhooping cough or measles (uncommon in the United States due to vaccination)\n                \nTuberculosis\n                \nFungal infections\n                \nConditions that damage the airways and raise the risk of lung infections also can lead to bronchiectasis. Examples of such conditions include:\n                \nCystic fibrosis. This disease leads to almost half of the cases of bronchiectasis in the United States.\n                \nImmunodeficiency disorders, such as common variable immunodeficiency and, less often, HIV and AIDS.\n                \nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (AS-per-ji-LO-sis). This is an allergic reaction to a fungus called aspergillus. The reaction causes swelling in the airways.\n                \nDisorders that affect cilia (SIL-e-ah) function, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia are small, hair-like structures that line your airways. They help clear mucus (a slimy substance) out of your airways.\n                \nChronic (ongoing) pulmonary aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun). This is a condition in which you inhale food, liquids, saliva, or vomited stomach contents into your lungs. Aspiration can inflame the airways, which can lead to bronchiectasis.\n                \nConnective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjgrens syndrome, and Crohns disease.\n                \nOther conditions, such as an airway blockage, also can lead to bronchiectasis. Many things can cause a blockage, such as a growth or a noncancerous tumor. An inhaled object, such as a piece of a toy or a peanut that you inhaled as a child, also can cause an airway blockage.\n                \nA problem with how the lungs form in a fetus may cause congenital bronchiectasis. This condition affects infants and children.",

        "answer": "The initial airway damage that leads to bronchiectasis often begins in childhood. However, signs and symptoms may not appear until months or even years after you start having repeated lung infections.\n                \nThe most common signs and symptoms of bronchiectasis are:\n                \nA daily cough that occurs over months or years\n                \nDaily production of large amounts of sputum (spit). Sputum, which you cough up and spit out, may contain mucus (a slimy substance), trapped particles, and pus.\n                \nShortness of breath and wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe)\n                \nChest pain\n                \nClubbing (the flesh under your fingernails and toenails gets thicker)\n                \nIf your doctor listens to your lungs with a stethoscope, he or she may hear abnormal lung sounds.\n                \nOver time, you may have more serious symptoms. You may cough up blood or bloody mucus and feel very tired. Children may lose weight or not grow at a normal rate.\n                \nComplications of Bronchiectasis\n                \nSevere bronchiectasis can lead to other serious health conditions, such as respiratory failure and atelectasis.\n                \nRespiratory failure is a condition in which not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood. The condition also can occur if your lungs can't properly remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood.\n                \nRespiratory failure can cause shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and air hunger (feeling like you can't breathe in enough air). In severe cases, signs and symptoms may include a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails; confusion; and sleepiness.\n                \nAtelectasis is a condition in which one or more areas of your lungs collapse or don't inflate properly. As a result, you may feel short of breath. Your heart rate and breathing rate may increase, and your skin and lips may turn blue.\n                \nIf bronchiectasis is so advanced that it affects all parts of your airways, it may cause heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n                \nThe most common signs and symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing, tiredness, and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck.",

        "answer": "Your doctor may suspect bronchiectasis if you have a daily cough that produces large amounts of sputum (spit).\n                \nTo find out whether you have bronchiectasis, your doctor may recommend tests to:\n                \nIdentify any underlying causes that require treatment\n                \nRule out other causes of your symptoms\n                \nFind out how much your airways are damaged\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nChest CT Scan\n                \nA chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, is the most common test for diagnosing bronchiectasis.\n                \nThis painless test creates precise pictures of your airways and other structures in your chest. A chest CT scan can show the extent and location of lung damage. This test gives more detailed pictures than a standard chest x ray.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nThis painless test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. A chest x ray can show areas of abnormal lung and thickened, irregular airway walls.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend other tests, such as:\n                \nBlood tests. These tests can show whether you have an underlying condition that can lead to bronchiectasis. Blood tests also can show whether you have an infection or low levels of certain infection-fighting blood cells.\n                \nA sputum culture. Lab tests can show whether a sample of your sputum contains bacteria (such as the bacteria that cause tuberculosis) or fungi.\n                \nLung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. Lung function tests help show how much lung damage you have.\n                \nA sweat test or other tests for cystic fibrosis.\n                \nBronchoscopy\n                \nIf your bronchiectasis doesn't respond to treatment, your doctor may recommend bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee). Doctors use this procedure to look inside the airways.\n                \nDuring bronchoscopy, a flexible tube with a light on the end is inserted through your nose or mouth into your airways. The tube is called a bronchoscope. It provides a video image of your airways. You'll be given medicine to numb your upper airway and help you relax during the procedure.\n                \nBronchoscopy can show whether you have a blockage in your airways. The procedure also can show the source of any bleeding in your airways.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for Bronchiectasis ?",
        "answer": "Bronchiectasis often is treated with medicines, hydration, and chest physical therapy (CPT). Your doctor may recommend surgery if the bronchiectasis is isolated to a section of lung or you have a lot of bleeding.\n                \nIf the bronchiectasis is widespread and causing respiratory failure, your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy.\n                \nThe goals of treatment are to:\n                \nTreat any underlying conditions and lung infections.\n                \nRemove mucus (a slimy substance) from your lungs. Maintaining good hydration helps with mucus removal.\n                \nPrevent complications.\n                \nEarly diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of bronchiectasis may help prevent further lung damage.\n                \nIn addition, any disease associated with the bronchiectasis, such as cystic fibrosisor immunodeficiency, also should be treated.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe antibiotics, bronchodilators, expectorants, or mucus-thinning medicines to treat bronchiectasis.\n                \nAntibiotics\n                \nAntibiotics are the main treatment for the repeated lung infections that bronchiectasis causes. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat these infections.\n                \nFor hard-to-treat infections, your doctor may prescribe intravenous (IV) antibiotics. These medicines are given through an IV line inserted into your arm. Your doctor may help you arrange for a home care provider to give you IV antibiotics at home.\n                \nExpectorants and Mucus-Thinning Medicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe expectorants and mucus thinners to help you cough up mucus.\n                \nExpectorants help loosen the mucus in your lungs. They often are combined with decongestants, which may provide extra relief. Mucus thinners, such as acetylcysteine, loosen the mucus to make it easier to cough up.\n                \nFor some of these treatments, little information is available to show how well they work.\n                \nHydration\n                \nDrinking plenty of fluid, especially water, helps prevent airway mucus from becoming thick and sticky. Good hydration helps keep airway mucus moist and slippery, which makes it easier to cough up.\n                \nChest Physical Therapy\n                \nCPT also is called physiotherapy (FIZ-e-o-THER-ah-pe) or chest clapping or percussion. This technique is generally performed by a respiratory therapist but can be done by a trained member of the family. It involves the therapist pounding your chest and back over and over with his or her hands or a device. Doing this helps loosen the mucus from your lungs so you can cough it up.\n                \nYou can sit with your head tilted down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\n                \nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices can help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency air waves to force mucus toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small handheld device that you breathe out through. It causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\n                \nA mask that creates vibrations to help break loose mucus from your airway walls.\n                \nSome of these methods and devices are popular with patients and doctors, but little information is available on how well they actually work. Choice usually is based on convenience and cost.\n                \nSeveral breathing techniques also are used to help move mucus to the upper airway so it can be coughed up. These techniques include forced expiration technique (FET) and active cycle breathing (ACB).\n                \nFET involves forcing out a couple of breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. ACB is FET that involves deep breathing exercises.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nDepending on your condition, your doctor also may recommend bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, oxygen therapy, or surgery.\n                \nBronchodilators\n                \nBronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are inhaled medicines. You will use an inhaler or a nebulizer to breathe in a fine mist of medicine.\n                \nInhaled bronchodilators work quickly because the medicine goes straight to your lungs. Your doctor may recommend that you use a bronchodilator right before you do CPT.\n                \nInhaled Corticosteroids\n                \nIf you also have wheezing or asthma with your bronchiectasis, your doctor may prescribe inhaled corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation in the airways).\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nOxygen therapy can help raise low blood oxygen levels. For this treatment, you'll receive oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. Oxygen therapy can be done at home, in a hospital, or in another health facility. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.)\n                \nSurgery\n                \nYour doctor may recommend surgery if no other treatments have helped and only one part of your airway is affected. If you have major bleeding in your airway, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove part of your airway or a procedure to control the bleeding.\n                \nIn very rare instances of severe bronchiectasis, your doctor may recommend that you receive a lung transplant replacing your diseased lungs with a healthy set of lungs.",
