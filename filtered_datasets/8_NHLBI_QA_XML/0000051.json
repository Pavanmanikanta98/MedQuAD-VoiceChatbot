        "question": "What is (are) Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
        "answer": "Espaol\n                \nDeep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together.\n                \nMost deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. They also can occur in other parts of the body.\n                \nA blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. The loose clot is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). It can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE.\n                \nPE is a very serious condition. It can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death.\n                \nBlood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause PE than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body. Blood clots also can form in veins closer to the skin's surface. However, these clots won't break off and cause PE.\n                \nThe animation below shows a deep vein blood clot.

        "question": "What causes Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
        "answer": "Blood clots can form in your body's deep veins if:\n                \nA vein's inner lining is damaged. Injuries caused by physical, chemical, or biological factors can damage the veins. Such factors include surgery, serious injuries, inflammation, and immune responses.\n                \nBlood flow is sluggish or slow. Lack of motion can cause sluggish or slow blood flow. This may occur after surgery, if you're ill and in bed for a long time, or if you're traveling for a long time.\n                \nYour blood is thicker or more likely to clot than normal. Some inherited conditions (such as factor V Leiden) increase the risk of blood clotting. Hormone therapy or birth control pills also can increase the risk of clotting.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
        "answer": "The signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) might be related to DVT itself or pulmonary embolism (PE). See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of either condition. Both DVT and PE can cause serious, possibly life-threatening problems if not treated.\n                \nDeep Vein Thrombosis\n                \nOnly about half of the people who have DVT have signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms occur in the leg affected by the deep vein clot. They include:\n                \nSwelling of the leg or along a vein in the leg\n                \nPain or tenderness in the leg, which you may feel only when standing or walking\n                \nIncreased warmth in the area of the leg that's swollen or painful\n                \nRed or discolored skin on the leg\n                \nPulmonary Embolism\n                \nSome people aren't aware of a deep vein clot until they have signs and symptoms of PE.

        "question": "How to diagnose Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will identify your risk factors and rule out other causes of your symptoms.\n                \nFor some people, DVT might not be diagnosed until after they receive emergency treatment for pulmonary embolism (PE).\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTo learn about your medical history, your doctor may ask about:\n                \nYour overall health\n                \nAny prescription medicines you're taking\n                \nAny recent surgeries or injuries you've had\n                \nWhether you've been treated for cancer\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check your legs for signs of DVT, such as swelling or redness. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests to find out whether you have DVT.\n                \nCommon Tests\n                \nThe most common test for diagnosing deep vein blood clots is ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of blood flowing through the arteries and veins in the affected leg.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a D-dimer test or venography (ve-NOG-rah-fee).\n                \nA D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot dissolves. If the test shows high levels of the substance, you may have a deep vein blood clot. If your test results are normal and you have few risk factors, DVT isn't likely.\n                \nYour doctor may suggest venography if an ultrasound doesn't provide a clear diagnosis. For venography, dye is injected into a vein in the affected leg. The dye makes the vein visible on an x-ray image. The x ray will show whether blood flow is slow in the vein, which may suggest a blood clot.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests used to diagnose DVT include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee), or CT, scanning. These tests create pictures of your organs and tissues.\n                \nYou may need blood tests to check whether you have an inherited blood clotting disorder that can cause DVT. This may be the case if you have repeated blood clots that are not related to another cause. Blood clots in an unusual location (such as the liver, kidney, or brain) also may suggest an inherited clotting disorder.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have PE, he or she may recommend more tests, such as a lung ventilation perfusion scan (VQ scan). A lung VQ scan shows how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of the lungs.\n                \nFor more information about diagnosing PE, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Embolism article.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
        "answer": "Doctors treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with medicines and other devices and therapies. The main goals of treating DVT are to:\n                \nStop the blood clot from getting bigger\n                \nPrevent the blood clot from breaking off and moving to your lungs\n                \nReduce your chance of having another blood clot\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent or treat DVT.\n                \nAnticoagulants\n                \nAnticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants) are the most common medicines for treating DVT. They're also known as blood thinners.\n                \nThese medicines decrease your blood's ability to clot. They also stop existing blood clots from getting bigger. However, blood thinners can't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most blood clots with time.)\n                \nBlood thinners can be taken as a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection).\n                \nWarfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat DVT. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you.\n                \nYour doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped.\n                \nPregnant women usually are treated with just heparin because warfarin is dangerous during pregnancy.\n                \nTreatment for DVT using blood thinners usually lasts for 6 months. The following situations may change the length of treatment:\n                \nIf your blood clot occurred after a short-term risk (for example, surgery), your treatment time may be shorter.\n                \nIf you've had blood clots before, your treatment time may be longer.\n                \nIf you have certain other illnesses, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners for as long as you have the illness.\n                \nThe most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. Bleeding can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.\n                \nSometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually have regular blood tests to measure their blood's ability to clot. These tests are called PT and PTT tests.\n                \nThese tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you have easy bruising or bleeding. These may be signs that your medicines have thinned your blood too much.\n                \nThrombin Inhibitors\n                \nThese medicines interfere with the blood clotting process. They're used to treat blood clots in patients who can't take heparin.\n                \nThrombolytics\n                \nDoctors prescribe these medicines to quickly dissolve large blood clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations.\n                \nOther Types of Treatment\n                \nVena Cava Filter\n                \nIf you can't take blood thinners or they're not working well, your doctor may recommend a vena cava filter.\n                \nThe filter is inserted inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. However, the filter doesn't stop new blood clots from forming.\n                \nGraduated Compression Stockings\n                \nGraduated compression stockings can reduce leg swelling caused by a blood clot. These stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee.\n                \nCompression stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting.\n                \nThere are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose, which offer the least amount of pressure.\n                \nThe second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.\n                \nPrescription-strength compression hose offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, a specially trained person needs to fit you for these stockings.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about how long you should wear compression stockings.",
