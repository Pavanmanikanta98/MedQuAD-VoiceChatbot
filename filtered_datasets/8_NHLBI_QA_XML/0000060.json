        "question": "What causes Heart Disease in Women ?",
        "answer": "Research suggests thatcoronary heart disease(CHD) begins with damage to the lining and inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. Several factors contribute to this damage. They include:\n                \nSmoking, including secondhand smoke\n                \nHigh amounts of certain fats andcholesterol in the blood\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes\n                \nBlood vessel inflammation\n                \nPlaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood.\n                \nOver time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause chest pain or discomfort calledangina.\n                \nIf the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsenangina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack.\n                \nIn addition to the factors above, low estrogen levels before or after menopause may play a role in causingcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the heart's tiny arteries.\n                \nThe cause of broken heart syndrome isn't yet known. However, a sudden release of stress hormones may play a role in causing the disorder. Most cases of broken heart syndrome occur in women who have gone through menopause.",

        "question": "Who is at risk for Heart Disease in Women? ?",
        "answer": "Certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk forcoronary heart disease(CHD). These conditions are known as risk factors. Risk factors also increase the chance that existing CHD will worsen.\n                \nWomen generally have the same CHD risk factors as men. However, some risk factors may affect women differently than men. For example, diabetes raises the risk of CHD more in women. Also, some risk factors, such as birth control pills and menopause, only affect women.\n                \nThere are many known CHD risk factors. Your risk for CHD andheart attackrises with the number of risk factors you have and their severity. Risk factors tend to \"gang up\" and worsen each other's effects.\n                \nHaving just one risk factor doubles your risk for CHD. Having two risk factors increases your risk for CHD fourfold. Having three or more risk factors increases your risk for CHD more than tenfold.\n                \nAlso, some risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes, put you at greater risk for CHD and heart attack than others.\n                \nMore than 75 percent of women aged 40 to 60 have one or more risk factors for CHD. Many risk factors start during childhood; some even develop within the first 10 years of life. You can control most risk factors, but some you can't.\n                \nFor more information about CHD risk factors, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factorsarticle. To find out whether you're at risk for CHD, talk with your doctor or health care provider.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can Control\n                \nSmoking\n                \nSmoking is the most powerful risk factor that women can control. Smoking tobacco or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke raises your risk for CHD and heart attack.\n                \nSmoking exposes you to carbon monoxide. This chemical robs your blood of oxygen and triggers a buildup of plaque in your arteries.\n                \nSmoking also increases the risk of blood clots forming in your arteries. Blood clots can block plaque-narrowed arteries and cause a heart attack. The more you smoke, the greater your risk for a heart attack.\n                \nEven women who smoke fewer than two cigarettes a day are at increased risk for CHD.\n                \nHigh Blood Cholesterol and High Triglyceride Levels\n                \nCholesterol travels in the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (LI-po-pro-teens). The two major kinds of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n                \nLDL cholesterol is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol to tissues, including your heart arteries. HDL cholesterol is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\n                \nA blood test called a lipoprotein panel is used to measure cholesterol levels. This test gives information about your total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood).\n                \nCholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. A woman's risk for CHD increases if she has a total cholesterol level greater than 200 mg/dL, an LDL cholesterol level greater than 100 mg/dL, or an HDL cholesterol level less than 50 mg/dL.\n                \nA triglyceride level greater than 150 mg/dL also increases a woman's risk for CHD. A woman's HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels predict her risk for CHD better than her total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels.\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.\n                \nWomen who have blood pressure greater than 120/80 mmHg are at increased risk for CHD. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)\n                \nHigh blood pressure is defined differently for people who have diabetes or chronic kidney disease. If you have one of these diseases, work with your doctor to set a healthy blood pressure goal.\n                \nDiabetes and Prediabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood sugar level is too high. This is because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.\n                \nInsulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells, where it's used for energy. Over time, a high blood sugar level can lead to increased plaque buildup in your arteries.\n                \nPrediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. Prediabetes puts you at higher risk for both diabetes and CHD.\n                \nDiabetes and prediabetes raise the risk of CHD more in women than in men. In fact, having diabetes doubles a woman's risk of developing CHD.\n                \nBefore menopause, estrogen provides women some protection against CHD. However, in women who have diabetes, the disease counters the protective effects of estrogen.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity\n                \nThe terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n                \nThe most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nYou can use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\n                \nStudies suggest that where extra weight occurs on the body may predict CHD risk better than BMI. Women who carry much of their fat around the waist are at greatest risk for CHD. These women have \"apple-shaped\" figures.\n                \nWomen who carry most of their fat on their hips and thighsthat is, those who have \"pear-shaped\" figuresare at lower risk for CHD.\n                \nTo fully know how excess weight affects your CHD risk, you should know your BMI and waist measurement. If you have a BMI greater than 24.9 and a waist measurement greater than 35 inches, you're at increased risk for CHD.\n                \nIf your waist measurement divided by your hip measurement is greater than 0.9, you're also at increased risk for CHD.\n                \nStudies also suggest that women whose weight goes up and down dramatically (typically due to unhealthy dieting) are at increased risk for CHD. These swings in weight can lower HDL cholesterol levels.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndromeis the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:\n                \nA large waistline. Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\n                \nA higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).\n                \nA lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol).\n                \nHigher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\n                \nHigher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes)\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is more common in African American women and Mexican American women than in men of the same racial groups. The condition affects White women and men about equally.\n                \nBirth Control Pills\n                \nWomen who smoke and take birth control pills are at very high risk for CHD, especially if they're older than 35. For women who take birth control pills but don't smoke, the risk of CHD isn't fully known.\n                \nLack of Physical Activity\n                \nInactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop CHD as those who are physically active. A lack of physical activity can worsen other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, diabetes and prediabetes, and overweight and obesity.\n                \nUnhealthy Diet\n                \nAn unhealthy diet can raise your risk for CHD. For example, foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise your LDL cholesterol level. A high-sodium (salt) diet can raise your risk for high blood pressure.\n                \nFoods with added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. This can cause you to gain weight, which raises your risk for CHD.\n                \nToo much alcohol also can cause you to gain weight, and it will raise your blood pressure.\n                \nStress or Depression\n                \nStress may play a role in causing CHD. Stress can trigger your arteries to narrow. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk for a heart attack.\n                \nGetting upset or angry also can trigger a heart attack. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk for CHD if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar.\n                \nPeople who are depressed are two to three times more likely to develop CHD than people who are not. Depression is twice as common in women as in men.\n                \nAnemia\n                \nAnemia (uh-NEE-me-eh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nThe condition also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your organs.\n                \nIf you have anemia, your organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood. This causes your heart to work harder, which may raise your risk for CHD.\n                \nAnemia has many causes. For more information, go to the Health Topics Anemiaarticle.\n                \nSleep Apnea\n                \nSleep apneais a common disorder that causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They often occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour.\n                \nTypically, normal breathing starts again after the pause, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound. Major signs of sleep apnea are snoring and daytime sleepiness.\n                \nWhen you stop breathing, the lack of oxygen triggers your body's stress hormones. This causes blood pressure to rise and makes the blood more likely to clot.\n                \nUntreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke.\n                \nWomen are more likely to develop sleep apnea after menopause.\n                \nRisk Factors You Can't Control\n                \nAge and Menopause\n                \nAs you get older, your risk for CHD and heart attack rises. This is due in part to the slow buildup of plaque inside your heart arteries, which can start during childhood.\n                \nBefore age 55, women have a lower risk for CHD than men. Estrogen provides women with some protection against CHD before menopause. After age 55, however, the risk of CHD increases in both women and men.\n                \nYou may have gone through early menopause, either naturally or because you had your ovaries removed. If so, you're twice as likely to develop CHD as women of the same age who aren't yet menopausal.\n                \nAnother reason why women are at increased risk for CHD after age 55 is that middle age is when you tend to develop other CHD risk factors.\n                \nWomen who have gone through menopause also are at increased risk for broken heart syndrome. (For more information, go to the section on emerging risk factors below.)\n                \nFamily History\n                \nFamily history plays a role in CHD risk. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with CHD before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with CHD before 65 years of age.\n                \nAlso, a family history of strokeespecially a mother's stroke historycan help predict the risk of heart attack in women.\n                \nHaving a family history of CHD or stroke doesn't mean that you'll develop heart disease. This is especially true if your affected family member smoked or had other risk factors that were not well treated.\n                \nMaking lifestyle changes and taking medicines to treat risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent or delay heart problems.\n                \nPreeclampsia\n                \nPreeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah) is a condition that develops during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine.\n                \nThese signs usually occur during the second half of pregnancy and go away after delivery. However, your risk of developing high blood pressure later in life increases after having preeclampsia.\n                \nPreeclampsia also is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, and heart failure. (Likewise, having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes or obesity, increases your risk for preeclampsia.)\n                \nIf you had preeclampsia during pregnancy, you're twice as likely to develop heart disease as women who haven't had the condition. You're also more likely to develop heart disease earlier in life.\n                \nPreeclampsia is a heart disease risk factor that you can't control. However, if you've had the condition, you should take extra care to try and control other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nThe more severe your preeclampsia was, the greater your risk for heart disease. Let your doctor know that you had preeclampsia so he or she can assess your heart disease risk and how to reduce it.\n                \nEmerging Risk Factors\n                \nResearch suggests that inflammation plays a role in causing CHD. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow.\n                \nHigh blood levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) are a sign of inflammation in the body. Research suggests that women who have high blood levels of CRP are at increased risk for heart attack.\n                \nAlso, some inflammatory diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may increase the risk for CHD.\n                \nSome studies suggest that women who have migraine headaches may be at greater risk for CHD. This is especially true for women who have migraines with auras (visual disturbances), such as flashes of light or zig-zag lines.\n                \nLow bone density and low intake of folate and vitamin B6 also may raise a woman's risk for CHD.\n                \nMore research is needed to find out whether calcium supplements with or without vitamin D affect CHD risk. You may want to talk with your doctor to find out whether these types of supplements are right for you.\n                \nResearchers are just starting to learn about broken heart syndrome risk factors. Most women who have this disorder are White and have gone through menopause.\n                \nMany of these women have other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. However, these risk factors tend to be less common in women who have broken heart syndrome than in women who have CHD.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Heart Disease in Women ?",
        "answer": "The signs and symptoms ofcoronary heart disease(CHD) may differ between women and men. Some women who have CHD have no signs or symptoms. This is called silent CHD.\n                \nSilent CHD may not be diagnosed until a woman has signs and symptoms of aheart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia(irregular heartbeat).\n                \nOther women who have CHD will have signs and symptoms of the disease.\n                \nHeart Disease Signs and Symptoms\n                \n\n                \nA common symptom of CHD isangina.Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nIn men, angina often feels like pressure or squeezing in the chest. This feeling may extend to the arms. Women can also have these angina symptoms. But women also tend to describe a sharp, burning chest pain. Women are more likely to have pain in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back.\n                \nIn men, angina tends to worsen with physical activity and go away with rest. Women are more likely than men to have angina while they're resting or sleeping.\n                \nIn women who havecoronary microvascular disease, angina often occurs during routine daily activities, such as shopping or cooking, rather than while exercising. Mental stress also is more likely to trigger angina pain in women than in men.\n                \nThe severity of angina varies. The pain may get worse or occur more often as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms Coronary Heart Disease Complications\n                \nHeart Attack\n                \nThe most common heart attack symptom in men and women is chest pain or discomfort. However, only half of women who have heart attacks have chest pain.\n                \nWomen are more likely than men to report back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, extreme fatigue (tiredness), or problems breathing.\n                \nHeart attacks also can cause upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Other heart attack symptoms are light-headedness and dizziness, which occur more often in women than men.\n                \nMen are more likely than women to break out in a cold sweat and to report pain in the left arm during a heart attack.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart can't cope with the demands of everyday activities.\n                \nHeart failure causes shortness of breath and fatigue that tends to increase with physical exertion. Heart failure also can cause swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck.\n                \nArrhythmia\n                \nAn arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.\n                \nSome people describe arrhythmias as fluttering or thumping feelings or skipped beats in their chests. These feelings are calledpalpitations.\n                \nSome arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. This condition is calledsudden cardiac arrest(SCA). SCA causes loss of consciousness and death if it's not treated right away.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Broken Heart Syndrome\n                \nThe most common signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome are chest pain and shortness of breath. In this disorder, these symptoms tend to occur suddenly in people who have no history of heart disease.\n                \nArrhythmias orcardiogenic shockalso may occur. Cardiogenic shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n                \nSome of the signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome differ from those of heart attack. For example, in people who have broken heart syndrome:\n                \nSymptoms occur suddenly after having extreme emotional or physical stress.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram) results don't look the same as the EKG results for a person having a heart attack. (An EKG is a test that records the heart's electrical activity.)\n                \nBlood tests show no signs or mild signs of heart damage.\n                \nTests show no signs of blockages in the coronary arteries.\n                \nTests show ballooning and unusual movement of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle).\n                \nRecovery time is quick, usually within days or weeks (compared with the recovery time of a month or more for a heart attack).",

        "question": "How to diagnose Heart Disease in Women ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnosecoronary heart disease(CHD) based on your medical and family histories, your risk factors, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nNo single test can diagnose CHD. If your doctor thinks you have CHD, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKGis a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nAn EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack.\n                \nStress Testing\n                \nDuringstress testing,you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicines to increase your heart rate.\n                \nWhen your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed coronary (heart) arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs.\n                \nA stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as:\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure\n                \nShortness of breath or chest pain\n                \nAbnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity\n                \nIf you can't exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age, your heart may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. However, other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough (for example, lung diseases,anemia, or poor general fitness).\n                \nAs part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nEcho also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nAchest x raycreates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.\n                \nA chest x ray can reveal signs ofheart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nBlood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for CHD. Blood tests also help detectanemia,a risk factor for CHD.\n                \nDuring a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. High levels of these proteins are a sign of a recent heart attack.\n                \nCoronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization\n                \nYour doctor may recommendcoronary angiography(an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors suggest you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to look inside your coronary arteries.\n                \nTo get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure calledcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun).\n                \nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.\n                \nSpecial x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nCoronary angiography detects blockages in the large coronary arteries. However, the test doesn't detectcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). This is because coronary MVD doesn't cause blockages in the large coronary arteries.\n                \nEven if the results of your coronary angiography are normal, you may still have chest pain or other CHD symptoms. If so, talk with your doctor about whether you might have coronary MVD.\n                \nYour doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire called the Duke Activity Status Index. This questionnaire measures how easily you can do routine tasks. It gives your doctor information about how well blood is flowing through your coronary arteries.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend other tests that measure blood flow in the heart, such as acardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) stress test.\n                \nCardiac MRI uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it beats. The test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels.\n                \nOther tests done during cardiac catheterization can check blood flow in the heart's small arteries and the thickness of the artery walls.\n                \nTests Used To Diagnose Broken Heart Syndrome\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have broken heart syndrome, he or she may recommend coronary angiography. Other tests are also used to diagnose this disorder, including blood tests, EKG, echo, and cardiac MRI.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for Heart Disease in Women ?",
        "answer": "Treatment forcoronary heart disease (CHD) usually is the same for both women and men. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical and surgical procedures, andcardiac rehabilitation(rehab).\n                \nThe goals of treatment are to:\n                \nRelieve symptoms.\n                \nReduce risk factors in an effort to slow, stop, or reverse the buildup of plaque.\n                \nLower the risk of blood clots forming. (Blood clots can cause aheart attack.)\n                \nWiden or bypass plaque-clogged coronary (heart) arteries.\n                \nPrevent CHD complications.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nMaking lifestyle changes can help prevent or treat CHD. These changes may be the only treatment that some people need.\n                \nQuit Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke or use tobacco, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD and heart attack and worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you find it hard to quit smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nFollow a Healthy Diet\n                \nA healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. These foods can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. A good rule is to try to fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits.\n                \nA healthy diet also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\n                \nChoose and prepare foods with little sodium (salt). Too much salt can raise your risk for high blood pressure. Studies show that following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan can lower blood pressure.\n                \nTry to avoid foods and drinks that are high in added sugars. For example, drink water instead of sugary drinks, like soda.\n                \nAlso, try to limit the amount of solid fats and refined grains that you eat. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).\n                \nIf you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Research suggests that regularly drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may lower the risk of CHD. Women should have no more than one alcoholic drink a day.\n                \nOne drink a day can lower your CHD risk by raising your HDL cholesterol level. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.\n                \nIf you don't drink, this isn't a recommendation to start using alcohol. Also, you shouldn't drink if you're pregnant, if you're planning to become pregnant, or if you have another health condition that could make alcohol use harmful.\n                \nToo much alcohol can cause you to gain weight and raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. In women, even one drink a day may raise the risk of certain types of cancer.\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH\" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nBe Physically Active\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many CHD risk factors, including high LDL cholesterol,high blood pressure, and excess weight.\n                \nPhysical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. (HDL cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.)\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \nPeople gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Walking is an excellent heart healthy exercise. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nMaintain a Healthy Weight\n                \nOverweight and obesity are risk factors for CHD. If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Cut back your calorie intake and do more physical activity. Eat smaller portions and choose lower calorie foods. Your health care provider may refer you to a dietitian to help you manage your weight.\n                \nA BMI of less than 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches or less is the goal for preventing and treating CHD. BMI measures your weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.\n                \nTo measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out. Make sure the tape is snug but doesn't squeeze the flesh.\n                \nFor more information about losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site.\n                \nStress and Depression\n                \nResearch shows that getting upset or angry can trigger a heart attack. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingaren't heart healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\n                \nHaving supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, yoga, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.\n                \nDepression can double or triple your risk for CHD. Depression also makes it hard to maintain a heart healthy lifestyle.\n                \nTalk with your doctor if you have symptoms of depression, such as feeling hopeless or not taking interest in daily activities. He or she may recommend counseling or prescribe medicines to help you manage the condition.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYou may need medicines to treat CHD if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Medicines can help:\n                \nReduce your heart's workload and relieve CHD symptoms\n                \nDecrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly\n                \nLower your LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and other CHD risk factors\n                \nPrevent blood clots\n                \nPrevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such asangioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\n                \nWomen who havecoronary microvascular disease and anemiamay benefit from taking medicine to treat the anemia.\n                \nWomen who have broken heart syndrome also may need medicines. Doctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Most people who have broken heart syndrome make a full recovery within weeks.\n                \nTake all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options.\n                \nMenopausal Hormone Therapy\n                \nRecent studies have shown that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) doesn't prevent CHD. Some studies have even shown that MHT increases women's risk for CHD, stroke, and breast cancer.\n                \nHowever, these studies tested MHT on women who had been postmenopausal for at least several years. During that time, they could have already developed CHD.\n                \nResearch is ongoing to see whether MHT helps prevent CHD when taken right when menopause starts. While questions remain, current findings suggest MHT shouldn't routinely be used to prevent or treat CHD.\n                \nAsk your doctor about other ways to prevent or treat CHD, including lifestyle changes and medicines. For more information about MHT, go to the NHLBI's Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Web site.\n                \nProcedures and Surgery\n                \nYou may need a procedure or surgery to treat CHD. Both angioplasty and CABG are used as treatments. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you.\n                \nPercutaneous Coronary Intervention\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee), is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries.\n                \nA thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery.\n                \nPCI can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics PCI article.\n                \nCoronary Artery Bypass Grafting\n                \nCABG is a type of surgery. During CABG, a surgeon removes arteries or veins from other areas in your body and uses them to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\n                \nCABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting article.\n                \nCardiac Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe cardiac rehab foranginaor after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Almost everyone who has CHD can benefit from cardiac rehab.\n                \nCardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.\n                \nThe cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.\n                \nCardiac rehab has two parts:\n                \nExercise training. This part of rehab helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.\n                \nEducation, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to lower your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and with your fears about the future.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Cardiac Rehabilitation article.",
