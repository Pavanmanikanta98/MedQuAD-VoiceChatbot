        "question": "What is (are) Cardiomyopathy ?",
        "answer": "Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, signs and symptoms, and treatments.\n                \nIn cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid. In rare cases, the muscle tissue in the heart is replaced with scar tissue.\n                \nAs cardiomyopathy worsens, the heart becomes weaker. It's less able to pump blood through the body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm. This can lead to heart failure or irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. In turn, heart failure can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen.\n                \nThe weakening of the heart also can cause other complications, such as heart valve problems.\n                \nOverview\n                \nThe types of cardiomyopathy are:\n                \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n                \nDilated cardiomyopathy\n                \nRestrictive cardiomyopathy\n                \nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia\n                \nUnclassified cardiomyopathy\n                \nCardiomyopathy can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren't born with the disease, but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the disease on to you. Many times, the cause of cardiomyopathy isn't known.\n                \nCardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages. However, people in certain age groups are more likely to have certain types of cardiomyopathy. This article focuses on cardiomyopathy in adults.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nSome people who have cardiomyopathy have no signs or symptoms and need no treatment. For other people, the disease develops quickly, symptoms are severe, and serious complications occur.\n                \nTreatments for cardiomyopathy include lifestyle changes, medicines, surgery, implanted devices to correct arrhythmias, and a nonsurgical procedure. These treatments can control symptoms, reduce complications, and stop the disease from getting worse.",

        "answer": "Cardiomyopathy can be acquired or inherited. Acquired means you arent born with the disease, but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor.\n                \nInherited means your parents passed the gene for the disease on to you. Researchers continue to look for the genetic links to cardiomyopathy and to explore how these links cause or contribute to the various types of the disease.\n                \nMany times, the cause of cardiomyopathy isnt known. This often is the case when the disease occurs in children.\n                \nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n                \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is inherited. Its caused by a mutation or change in some of the genes in heart muscle proteins. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also can develop over time because of high blood pressure, aging, or other diseases, such as diabetes or thyroid disease. Sometimes the cause of the disease isnt known.\n                \nDilated Cardiomyopathy\n                \nThe cause of dilated cardiomyopathy often isnt known. About one-third of the people who have dilated cardiomyopathy inherit it from their parents.\n                \nCertain diseases, conditions, and substances also can cause the disease, such as:\n                \nAlcohol, especially if you also have a poor diet\n                \nCertain toxins, such as poisons and heavy metals\n                \nComplications during the last months of pregnancy\n                \nCoronary heart disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disease, viral hepatitis, and HIV\n                \nIllegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, and some medicines used to treat cancer\n                \nInfections, especially viral infections that inflame the heart muscle\n                \nRestrictive Cardiomyopathy\n                \nCertain diseases, conditions, and factors can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, including:\n                \nAmyloidosis: A disease in which abnormal proteins build up in the bodys organs, including the heart\n                \nConnective tissue disorders\n                \nHemochromatosis: A disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. The extra iron is toxic to the body and can damage the organs, including the heart.\n                \nSarcoidosis: A disease that causes inflammation and can affect various organs in the body. Researchers believe that an abnormal immune response may cause sarcoidosis. This abnormal response causes tiny lumps of cells to form in the bodys organs, including the heart.\n                \nSome cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy\n                \nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia\n                \nResearchers think that arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is an inherited disease.",

        "answer": "People of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy. However, certain types of the disease are more common in certain groups.\n                \nDilated cardiomyopathy is more common in African Americans than Whites. This type of the disease also is more common in men than women.\n                \nTeens and young adults are more likely than older people to have arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, although it's rare in both groups.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nCertain diseases, conditions, or factors can raise your risk for cardiomyopathy. Major risk factors include:\n                \nA family history of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)\n                \nA disease or condition that can lead to cardiomyopathy, such as coronary heart disease, heart attack, or a viral infection that inflames the heart muscle\n                \nDiabetes or other metabolic diseases, or severe obesity\n                \nDiseases that can damage the heart, such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, or amyloidosis\n                \nLong-term alcoholism\n                \nLong-term high blood pressure\n                \nSome people who have cardiomyopathy never have signs or symptoms.

        "question": "How to diagnose Cardiomyopathy ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose cardiomyopathy based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nOften, a cardiologist or pediatric cardiologist diagnoses and treats cardiomyopathy. A cardiologist specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases. A pediatric cardiologist is a cardiologist who treats children.\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor will want to learn about your medical history. He or she will want to know what signs and symptoms you have and how long you've had them.\n                \nYour doctor also will want to know whether anyone in your family has had cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs for sounds that may suggest cardiomyopathy. These sounds may even suggest a certain type of the disease.\n                \nFor example, the loudness, timing, and location of a heart murmur may suggest obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A \"crackling\" sound in the lungs may be a sign of heart failure. (Heart failure often develops in the later stages of cardiomyopathy.)\n                \nPhysical signs also help your doctor diagnose cardiomyopathy. Swelling of the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, or veins in your neck suggests fluid buildup, a sign of heart failure.\n                \nYour doctor may notice signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy during a routine exam. For example, he or she may hear a heart murmur, or you may have abnormal test results.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose cardiomyopathy.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nDuring a blood test, a small amount of blood is taken from your body. It's often drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.\n                \nBlood tests give your doctor information about your heart and help rule out other conditions.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged. A chest x ray also can show whether fluid is building up in your lungs.\n                \nEKG (Electrocardiogram)\n                \nAn EKG is a simple test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nThis test is used to detect and study many heart problems, such as heart attacks, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart failure. EKG results also can suggest other disorders that affect heart function.\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect problems that don't happen during the test.\n                \nTo diagnose heart problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nHolter and event monitors are small, portable devices. They record your heart's electrical activity while you do your normal daily activities. A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period.\n                \nAn event monitor records your heart's electrical activity only at certain times while you're wearing it. For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape.\n                \nThere are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done as part of a stress test (see below). Stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease.\n                \nAnother type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE. TEE provides a view of the back of the heart.\n                \nFor this test, a sound wave wand is put on the end of a special tube. The tube is gently passed down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the heart, TEE can create detailed pictures of the heart's structures.\n                \nBefore TEE, you're given medicine to help you relax, and your throat is sprayed with numbing medicine.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done.\n                \nThese tests may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.\n                \nDiagnostic Procedures\n                \nYou may have one or more medical procedures to confirm a diagnosis or to prepare for surgery (if surgery is planned). These procedures may include cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-i-ZA-shun), coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee), or myocardial (mi-o-KAR-de-al) biopsy.\n                \nCardiac Catheterization\n                \nThis procedure checks the pressure and blood flow in your heart's chambers. The procedure also allows your doctor to collect blood samples and look at your heart's arteries using x-ray imaging.\n                \nDuring cardiac catheterization, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. This allows your doctor to study the inside of your arteries for blockages.\n                \nCoronary Angiography\n                \nThis procedure often is done with cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, dye that can be seen on an x ray is injected into your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study blood flow through your heart and blood vessels.\n                \nDye also may be injected into your heart chambers. This allows your doctor to study the pumping function of your heart.\n                \nMyocardial Biopsy\n                \nFor this procedure, your doctor removes a piece of your heart muscle. This can be done during cardiac catheterization. The heart muscle is studied under a microscope to see whether changes in cells have occurred. These changes may suggest cardiomyopathy.\n                \nMyocardial biopsy is useful for diagnosing some types of cardiomyopathy.\n                \nGenetic Testing\n                \nSome types of cardiomyopathy run in families. Thus, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to look for the disease in your parents, brothers and sisters, or other family members.\n                \nGenetic testing can show how the disease runs in families. It also can find out the chances of parents passing the genes for the disease on to their children.\n                \nGenetic testing also may be useful if your doctor thinks you have cardiomyopathy, but you don't yet have signs or symptoms. If the test shows you have the disease, your doctor can start treatment early, when it may work best.",

        "answer": "People who have cardiomyopathy but no signs or symptoms may not need treatment. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy that comes on suddenly may go away on its own. For other people who have cardiomyopathy, treatment is needed. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy you have, the severity of your symptoms and complications, and your age and overall health. Treatments may include:\n                \nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes\n                \nMedicines\n                \nNonsurgical procedure\n                \nSurgery and implanted devices\n                \nThe main goals of treating cardiomyopathy include:\n                \nControlling signs and symptoms so that you can live as normally as possible\n                \nManaging any conditions that cause or contribute to the disease\n                \nReducing complications and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest\n                \nStopping the disease from getting worse\n                \nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes\n                \nYour doctor may suggest lifestyle changes to manage a condition thats causing your cardiomyopathy including:\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nHeart-Healthy Eating\n                \nYour doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:\n                \nFat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk\n                \nFish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week\n                \nFruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\n                \nLegumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\n                \nVegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots\n                \nWhole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas\n                \nWhen following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:\n                \nA lot of red meat\n                \nPalm and coconut oils\n                \nSugary foods and beverages\n                \nTwo nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:\n                \nSaturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals\n                \nTrans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats such as stick margarine;baked goods such as, cookies, cakes, and pies, crackers, frostings, and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \nNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.\n                \nSome sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:\n                \nAvocados\n                \nCorn, sunflower, and soybean oils\n                \nNuts and seeds, such as walnuts\n                \nOlive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils\n                \nPeanut butter\n                \nSalmon and trout\n                \nTofu\n                \nSodium\n                \nTry to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.\n                \nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n                \nYour doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.\n                \nThe DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.\n                \nAlcohol\n                \nTalk to your doctor about how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Your doctor may recommend that you reduce the amount of alcohol you drinkor stop drinking alcohol.\n                \n\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) onlineBMI calculatoror talk to your doctor.A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nOf 30 or more is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visitAssessing Your Weight and Health Risk.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \n\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \n\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRoutine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats fasterand you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nRead more about physical activity at:\n                \nPhysical Activity and Your Heart\n                \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.\n                \n\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nRead more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMany medicines are used to treat cardiomyopathy. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to:\n                \nBalance electrolytes in your body. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They also help muscle and nerve tissues work properly. Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration (lack of fluid in your body), heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Aldosterone blockers are an example of a medicine used to balance electrolytes.\n                \nKeep your heart beating with a normal rhythm. These medicines, called antiarrhythmics, help prevent arrhythmias.\n                \nLower your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are examples of medicines that lower blood pressure.\n                \nPrevent blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, are an example of a medicine that prevents blood clots. Blood thinners often are used to prevent blood clots from forming in people who have dilated cardiomyopathy.\n                \nReduce inflammation. Corticosteroids are an example of a medicine used to reduce inflammation.\n                \nRemove excess sodium from your body. Diuretics, or water pills, are an example of medicines that help remove excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood.\n                \nSlow your heart rate. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are examples of medicines that slow the heart rate. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also are used to lower blood pressure.\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.\n                \nSurgery and Implanted Devices\n                \nDoctors use several types of surgery to treat cardiomyopathy, including septal myectomy, surgically implanted devices, and heart transplant.\n                \nSeptal Myectomy\n                \nSeptal myectomy is open-heart surgery and is used to treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms. This surgery generally is used for younger patients and for people whose medicines arent working well.\n                \nA surgeon removes part of the thickened septum thats bulging into the left ventricle. This improves blood flow through the heart and out to the body. The removed tissue doesnt grow back. If needed, the surgeon also can repair or replace the mitral valve at the same time. Septal myectomy often is successful and allows you to return to a normal life with nosymptoms.\n                \nSurgically Implanted Devices\n                \nSurgeons can place several types of devices in the heart to improve function and symptoms, including:\n                \nCardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. A CRT device coordinates contractions between the hearts left and right ventricles.\n                \nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD). An ICD helps control life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead tosudden cardiac arrest. This small device is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart with wires. If an ICD senses a dangerous change in heart rhythm, it will send an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.\n                \nLeft ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device helps the heart pump blood to the body. An LVAD can be used as a long-term therapy or as a short-term treatment for people who are waiting for a heart transplant.\n                \nPacemaker. This small device is placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control arrhythmias. The device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.\n                \nHeart Transplant\n                \nFor this surgery, a surgeon replaces a persons diseased heart with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. A heart transplant is a last resort treatment for people who have end-stage heart failure. End-stage means the condition has become so severe that all treatments, other than heart transplant, have failed. For more information about this treatment, go to the Heart Transplant Health Topic.\n                \nNonsurgical Procedure\n                \nDoctors may use a nonsurgical procedure called alcohol septal ablation to treat cardiomyopathy. During this procedure, the doctor injects ethanol (a type of alcohol) through a tube into the small artery that supplies blood to the thickened area of heart muscle. The alcohol kills cells, and the thickened tissue shrinks to a more normal size. This procedure allows blood to flow freely through the ventricle, which improves symptoms.",

        "answer": "You can't prevent inherited types of cardiomyopathy. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for diseases or conditions that may lead to or complicate cardiomyopathy. Examples includecoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, andheart attack.\n                \nYour doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\n                \nAvoiding the use of alcohol and illegal drugs\n                \nGetting enough sleep and rest\n                \nHeart-healthy eating\n                \nPhysicalactivity\n                \nQuitting smoking\n                \nManaging stress\n                \nYour cardiomyopathy may be due to an underlying disease or condition. If you treat that condition early enough, you may be able to prevent cardiomyopathy complications. For example, to control high blood pressure,high blood cholesterol, and diabetes:\n                \nFollow your doctors advice about lifestyle changes.\n                \nGet regular checkups with your doctor.\n                \nTake all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes.",
