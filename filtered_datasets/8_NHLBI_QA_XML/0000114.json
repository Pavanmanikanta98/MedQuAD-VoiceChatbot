        "question": "What is (are) Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move your legs. This urge to move often occurs with strange and unpleasant feelings in your legs. Moving your legs relieves the urge and the unpleasant feelings.\n                \nPeople who have RLS describe the unpleasant feelings as creeping, crawling, pulling, itching, tingling, burning, aching, or electric shocks. Sometimes, these feelings also occur in the arms.\n                \nThe urge to move and unpleasant feelings happen when you're resting and inactive. Thus, they tend to be worse in the evening and at night.\n                \nOverview\n                \nRLS can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep. It may make you feel tired and sleepy during the day. This can make it hard to learn, work, and do other daily activities. Not getting enough sleep also can cause depression, mood swings, or other health problems.\n                \nRLS can range from mild to severe based on:\n                \nThe strength of your symptoms and how often they occur\n                \nHow easily moving around relieves your symptoms\n                \nHow much your symptoms disturb your sleep\n                \nOne type of RLS usually starts early in life (before 45 years of age) and tends to run in families. It may even start in childhood. Once this type of RLS starts, it usually lasts for the rest of your life. Over time, symptoms slowly get worse and occur more often. If you have a mild case, you may have long periods with no symptoms.\n                \nAnother type of RLS usually starts later in life (after 45 years of age). It generally doesn't run in families. This type of RLS tends to have a more abrupt onset. The symptoms usually don't get worse over time.\n                \nSome diseases, conditions, and medicines may trigger RLS. For example, the disorder has been linked to kidney failure, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. When a disease, condition, or medicine causes RLS, the symptoms usually start suddenly.\n                \nMedical conditions or medicines often cause or worsen the type of RLS that starts later in life.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nRLS symptoms often get worse over time. However, some people's symptoms go away for weeks to months.\n                \nIf a medical condition or medicine triggers RLS, the disorder may go away if the trigger is relieved or stopped. For example, RLS that occurs due to pregnancy tends to go away after giving birth. Kidney transplants (but not dialysis) relieve RLS linked to kidney failure.\n                \nTreatments for RLS include lifestyle changes and medicines. Some simple lifestyle changes often help relieve mild cases of RLS. Medicines often can relieve or prevent the symptoms of more severe RLS.\n                \nResearch is ongoing to better understand the causes of RLS and to find better treatments.",

        "question": "What causes Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "Faulty Use of Iron or Lack of Iron\n                \nResearch suggests that the main cause of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a faulty use of iron or a lack of iron in the brain. The brain uses iron to make the chemical dopamine (DO-pah-meen) and to control other brain activities. Dopamine works in the parts of the brain that control movement.\n                \nMany conditions can affect how much iron is in the brain or how it's used. These conditions include kidney failure, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. All of these conditions increase your risk of RLS.\n                \nPeople whose family members have RLS also are more likely to develop the disorder. This suggests that genetics may contribute to the faulty use of iron or lack of iron in the brain that triggers RLS.\n                \nNerve Damage\n                \nNerve damage in the legs or feet and sometimes in the arms or hands may cause or worsen RLS. Several conditions can cause this type of nerve damage, including diabetes.\n                \nMedicines and Substances\n                \nCertain medicines may trigger RLS. These include some:\n                \nAntinausea medicines (used to treat upset stomach)\n                \nAntidepressants (used to treat depression)\n                \nAntipsychotics (used to treat certain mental health disorders)\n                \nCold and allergy medicines that contain antihistamines\n                \nCalcium channel blockers (used to treat heart problems and high blood pressure)\n                \nRLS symptoms usually get better or may even go away if the medicine is stopped.\n                \nCertain substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, also can trigger or worsen RLS symptoms. Symptoms may get better or go away if the substances are stopped.",

        "question": "Who is at risk for Restless Legs Syndrome? ?",
        "answer": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects about 515 percent of Americans. Many people who have RLS have family members with the disorder.\n                \nRLS can affect people of any racial or ethnic group, but the disorder is more common in people of Northern European descent. RLS affects both genders, but women are more likely to have it than men.\n                \nThe number of cases of RLS rises with age. Many people who have RLS are diagnosed in middle age. People who develop RLS early in life tend to have a family history of the disorder.\n                \nPeople who have certain diseases or conditions or who take certain medicines are more likely to develop RLS. (For more information, go to \"What Causes Restless Legs Syndrome?\")\n                \nFor example, pregnancy is a risk factor for RLS. It usually occurs during the last 3 months of pregnancy. The disorder usually improves or goes away after giving birth. Some women may continue to have symptoms after giving birth. Other women may develop RLS again later in life.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "The four key signs of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are:\n                \nA strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms.\n                \nSymptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting.\n                \nRelief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings.\n                \nSymptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night.\n                \nYou must have all four of these signs to be diagnosed with RLS.\n                \nThe Urge To Move\n                \nRLS gets its name from the urge to move the legs when sitting or lying down. This movement relieves the unpleasant feelings that RLS sometimes causes. Typical movements are:\n                \nPacing and walking\n                \nJiggling the legs\n                \nStretching and flexing\n                \nTossing and turning\n                \nRubbing the legs\n                \nUnpleasant Feelings\n                \nPeople who have RLS describe the unpleasant feelings in their limbs as creeping, crawling, pulling, itching, tingling, burning, aching, or electric shocks. Severe RLS may cause painful feelings. However, the pain usually is more of an ache than a sharp, stabbing pain.\n                \nChildren may describe RLS symptoms differently than adults. In children, the condition may occur with hyperactivity. However, it's not fully known how the disorders are related.\n                \nThe unpleasant feelings from RLS often occur in the lower legs (calves). But the feelings can occur at any place in the legs or feet. They also can occur in the arms.\n                \nThe feelings seem to come from deep within the limbs, rather than from the surface. You usually will have the feelings in both legs. However, the feelings can occur in one leg, move from one leg to the other, or affect one leg more than the other.\n                \nPeople who have mild symptoms may notice them only when they're still or awake for a long time, such as on a long airplane trip or while watching TV. If they fall asleep quickly, they may not have symptoms when lying down at night.\n                \nThe unpleasant feelings from RLS aren't the same as the leg cramps many people get at night. Leg cramps often are limited to certain muscle groups in the leg, which you can feel tightening. Leg cramps cause more severe pain and require stretching the affected muscle for relief.\n                \nSometimes arthritis or peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) can cause pain or discomfort in the legs. Moving the limbs usually worsens the discomfort instead of relieving it.\n                \nPeriodic Limb Movement in Sleep\n                \nMany people who have RLS also have a condition called periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS). PLMS causes your legs or arms to twitch or jerk about every 10 to 60 seconds during sleep. These movements cause you to wake up often and get less sleep.\n                \nPLMS usually affects the legs, but it also can affect the arms. Not everyone who has PLMS also has RLS.\n                \nRelated Sleep Problems\n                \nRLS can make it hard to fall or stay asleep. If RLS disturbs your sleep, you may feel very tired during the day.\n                \nLack of sleep may make it hard for you to concentrate at school or work. Not enough sleep also can cause depression, mood swings, and other health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure.",

        "question": "How to diagnose Restless Legs Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose restless legs syndrome (RLS) based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nYour doctor will use this information to rule out other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of RLS.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nYour primary care doctor usually can diagnose and treat RLS. However, he or she also may suggest that you see a sleep specialist or neurologist.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nYou must have the four key signs of RLS to be diagnosed with the disorder.\n                \nYour doctor will want to know how your symptoms are affecting your sleep and how alert you are during the day.\n                \nTo help your doctor, you may want to keep a sleep diary. Use the diary to keep a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep, how much sleep you get at night, and how alert you feel during the day.\n                \nFor a sample sleep diary, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\"\n                \nMedical and Family Histories\n                \nYour doctor may ask whether you have any of the diseases or conditions that can trigger RLS. These include kidney failure, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, and iron deficiency.\n                \nYour doctor also may want to know what medicines you take. Some medicines can trigger or worsen RLS.\n                \nThe most common type of RLS tends to run in families. Thus, your doctor may ask whether any of your relatives have RLS.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will do a physical exam to check for underlying conditions that may trigger RLS. He or she also will check for other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of RLS.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nCurrently, no test can diagnose RLS. Still, your doctor may recommend blood tests to measure your iron levels. He or she also may suggest muscle or nerve tests. These tests can show whether you have a condition that can worsen RLS or that has symptoms similar to those of RLS.\n                \nRarely, sleep studies are used to help diagnose RLS. A sleep study measures how much and how well you sleep. Although RLS can cause a lack of sleep, this sign isn't specific enough to diagnose the condition.\n                \nResearchers continue to study new ways to diagnose RLS.\n                \nDrug Therapy Trial\n                \nIf your doctor thinks you have RLS, he or she may prescribe certain medicines to relieve your symptoms. These medicines, which are used to treat people who have Parkinson's disease, also can relieve RLS symptoms. If the medicines relieve your symptoms, your doctor can confirm that you have RLS.",

        "answer": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has no cure. If a condition or medicine triggers RLS, it may go away or get better if the trigger is relieved or stopped.\n                \nRLS can be treated. The goals of treatment are to:\n                \nPrevent or relieve symptoms\n                \nIncrease the amount of sleep you're getting and improve the quality of your sleep\n                \nTreat or correct any underlying condition that may trigger or worsen RLS\n                \nMild cases of RLS often are treated with lifestyle changes and sometimes with periodic use of medicines. More severe RLS usually is treated with daily medicines.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes can prevent or relieve the symptoms of RLS. For mild RLS, lifestyle changes may be the only treatment needed.\n                \nPreventing Symptoms\n                \nMany common substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, can trigger RLS symptoms. Avoiding these substances can limit or prevent symptoms.\n                \nSome prescription and over-the-counter medicines can cause or worsen RLS symptoms. Tell your doctor about all of the medicines you're taking. He or she can tell you whether you should stop or change certain medicines.\n                \nAdopting good sleep habits can help you fall asleep and stay asleepa problem for many people who have RLS. Good sleep habits include:\n                \nKeeping the area where you sleep cool, quiet, comfortable, and as dark as possible.\n                \nMaking your bedroom sleep-friendly. Remove things that can interfere with sleep, such as a TV, computer, or phone.\n                \nGoing to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Some people who have RLS find it helpful to go to bed later in the evening and get up later in the morning.\n                \nAvoiding staying in bed awake for long periods in the evening or during the night.\n                \nDoing a challenging activity before bedtime, such as solving a crossword puzzle, may ease your RLS symptoms. This distraction may make it easier for you to fall asleep. Focusing on your breathing and using other relaxation techniques also may help you fall asleep.\n                \nRegular, moderate physical activity also can help limit or prevent RLS symptoms. Often, people who have RLS find that if they increase their activity during the day, they have fewer symptoms.\n                \nRelieving Symptoms\n                \nCertain activities can relieve RLS symptoms. These include:\n                \nWalking or stretching\n                \nTaking a hot or cold bath\n                \nMassaging the affected limb(s)\n                \nUsing heat or ice packs on the affected limb(s)\n                \nDoing mentally challenging tasks\n                \nChoose an aisle seat at the movies or on airplanes and trains so you can move around, if necessary.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYou may need medicines to treat RLS if lifestyle changes can't control symptoms. Many medicines can relieve or prevent RLS symptoms.\n                \nNo single medicine works for all people who have RLS. It may take several changes in medicines and dosages to find the best approach. Sometimes, a medicine will work for a while and then stop working.\n                \nSome of the medicines used to treat RLS also are used to treat Parkinson's disease. These medicines make dopamine or mimic it in the parts of the brain that control movement. (Dopamine is a chemical that helps you move properly.)\n                \nIf medicines for Parkinson's disease don't prevent or relieve your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe other medicines. You may have to take more than one medicine to treat your RLS.\n                \nAlways talk with your doctor before taking any medicines. He or she can tell you the side effects of each RLS medicine. Side effects may include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), headache, and daytime sleepiness.\n                \nIn some cases, RLS medicines may worsen problems with excessive gambling, shopping, or sexual activity. Sometimes, continued use of RLS medicines may make your RLS symptoms worse.\n                \nContact your doctor if you have any of these problems. He or she can adjust your medicines to prevent these side effects.",
