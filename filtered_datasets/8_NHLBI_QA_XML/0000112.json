        "question": "What is (are) Respiratory Distress Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a breathing disorder that affects newborns. RDS rarely occurs in full-term infants. The disorder is more common in premature infants born about 6 weeks or more before their due dates.\n                \nRDS is more common in premature infants because their lungs aren't able to make enough surfactant (sur-FAK-tant). Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that infants can breathe in air once they're born.\n                \nWithout enough surfactant, the lungs collapse and the infant has to work hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs. The lack of oxygen can damage the baby's brain and other organs if proper treatment isn't given.\n                \nMost babies who develop RDS show signs of breathing problems and a lack of oxygen at birth or within the first few hours that follow.\n                \nOverview\n                \nRDS is a common lung disorder in premature infants. In fact, nearly all infants born before 28 weeks of pregnancy develop RDS.\n                \nRDS might be an early phase of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (brong-ko-PUL-mo-nar-e dis-PLA-ze-ah), or BPD. This is another breathing disorder that affects premature babies.\n                \nRDS usually develops in the first 24 hours after birth. If premature infants still have breathing problems by the time they reach their original due dates, they may be diagnosed with BPD. Some of the life-saving treatments used for RDS may cause BPD.\n                \nSome infants who have RDS recover and never get BPD. Infants who do get BPD have lungs that are less developed or more damaged than the infants who recover.\n                \nInfants who develop BPD usually have fewer healthy air sacs and tiny blood vessels in their lungs. Both the air sacs and the tiny blood vessels that support them are needed to breathe well.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nDue to improved treatments and medical advances, most infants who have RDS survive. However, these babies may need extra medical care after going home.\n                \nSome babies have complications from RDS or its treatments. Serious complications include chronic (ongoing) breathing problems, such as asthma and BPD; blindness; and brain damage.",

        "question": "What causes Respiratory Distress Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "The main cause of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a lack of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs.\n                \nA fetus's lungs start making surfactant during the third trimester of pregnancy (weeks 26 through labor and delivery). The substance coats the insides of the air sacs in the lungs. This helps keep the lungs open so breathing can occur after birth.\n                \nWithout enough surfactant, the lungs will likely collapse when the infant exhales (breathes out). The infant then has to work harder to breathe. He or she might not be able to get enough oxygen to support the body's organs.\n                \nSome full-term infants develop RDS because they have faulty genes that affect how their bodies make surfactant.",

        "question": "Who is at risk for Respiratory Distress Syndrome? ?",
        "answer": "Certain factors may increase the risk that your infant will have respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). These factors include:\n                \nPremature delivery. The earlier your baby is born, the greater his or her risk for RDS. Most cases of RDS occur in babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n                \nStress during your baby's delivery, especially if you lose a lot of blood.\n                \nInfection.\n                \nYour having diabetes.\n                \nYour baby also is at greater risk for RDS if you require an emergency cesarean delivery (C-section) before your baby is full term. You may need an emergency C-section because of a condition, such as a detached placenta, that puts you or your infant at risk.\n                \nPlanned C-sections that occur before a baby's lungs have fully matured also can increase the risk of RDS. Your doctor can do tests before delivery that show whether it's likely that your baby's lungs are fully developed. These tests assess the age of the fetus or lung maturity.",

        "answer": "Signs and symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) usually occur at birth or within the first few hours that follow. They include:\n                \nRapid, shallow breathing\n                \nSharp pulling in of the chest below and between the ribs with each breath\n                \nGrunting sounds\n                \nFlaring of the nostrils\n                \nThe infant also may have pauses in breathing that last for a few seconds. This condition is called apnea (AP-ne-ah).\n                \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome Complications\n                \nDepending on the severity of an infant's RDS, he or she may develop other medical problems.\n                \nLung Complications\n                \nLung complications may include a collapsed lung (atelectasis), leakage of air from the lung into the chest cavity (pneumothorax), and bleeding in the lung (hemorrhage).\n                \nSome of the life-saving treatments used for RDS may cause bronchopulmonary dysplasia, another breathing disorder.\n                \nBlood and Blood Vessel Complications\n                \nInfants who have RDS may develop sepsis, an infection of the bloodstream. This infection can be life threatening.\n                \nLack of oxygen may prevent a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus from closing after birth as it should. This condition is called patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA.\n                \nThe ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery. If it remains open, it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries.\n                \nOther Complications\n                \nComplications of RDS also may include blindness and other eye problems and a bowel disease called necrotizing enterocolitis (EN-ter-o-ko-LI-tis). Infants who have severe RDS can develop kidney failure.\n                \nSome infants who have RDS develop bleeding in the brain. This bleeding can delay mental development. It also can cause mental retardation or cerebral palsy.",

        "answer": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is common in premature infants. Thus, doctors usually recognize and begin treating the disorder as soon as babies are born.\n                \nDoctors also do several tests to rule out other conditions that could be causing an infant's breathing problems. The tests also can confirm that the doctors have diagnosed the condition correctly.\n                \nThe tests include:\n                \nChest x ray. A chest x ray creates a of the structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. This test can show whether your infant has signs of RDS. A chest x ray also can detect problems, such as a collapsed lung, that may require urgent treatment.\n                \nBlood tests. Blood tests are used to see whether an infant has enough oxygen in his or her blood. Blood tests also can help find out whether an infection is causing the infant's breathing problems.\n                \nEchocardiography (echo). This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. Echo is used to rule out heart defects as the cause of an infant's breathing problems.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for Respiratory Distress Syndrome ?",
        "answer": "Treatment for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room.\n                \nMost infants who show signs of RDS are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There they receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.\n                \nThe most important treatments for RDS are:\n                \nSurfactant replacement therapy.\n                \nBreathing support from a ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machine. These machines help premature infants breathe better.\n                \nOxygen therapy.\n                \nSurfactant Replacement Therapy\n                \nSurfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\n                \nBabies who have RDS are given surfactant until their lungs are able to start making the substance on their own. Surfactant usually is given through a breathing tube. The tube allows the surfactant to go directly into the baby's lungs.\n                \nOnce the surfactant is given, the breathing tube is connected to a ventilator, or the baby may get breathing support from NCPAP.\n                \nSurfactant often is given right after birth in the delivery room to try to prevent or treat RDS. It also may be given several times in the days that follow, until the baby is able to breathe better.\n                \nSome women are given medicines called corticosteroids during pregnancy. These medicines can speed up surfactant production and lung development in a fetus. Even if you had these medicines, your infant may still need surfactant replacement therapy after birth.\n                \nBreathing Support\n                \nInfants who have RDS often need breathing support until their lungs start making enough surfactant. Until recently, a mechanical ventilator usually was used. The ventilator was connected to a breathing tube that ran through the infant's mouth or nose into the windpipe.\n                \nToday, more and more infants are receiving breathing support from NCPAP. NCPAP gently pushes air into the baby's lungs through prongs placed in the infant's nostrils.\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nInfants who have breathing problems may get oxygen therapy. Oxygen is given through a ventilator or NCPAP machine, or through a tube in the nose. This treatment ensures that the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nOther treatments for RDS include medicines, supportive therapy, and treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is a condition that affects some premature infants.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nDoctors often give antibiotics to infants who have RDS to control infections (if the doctors suspect that an infant has an infection).\n                \nSupportive Therapy\n                \nTreatment in the NICU helps limit stress on babies and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Such treatment may include:\n                \nUsing a radiant warmer or incubator to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.\n                \nOngoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.\n                \nUsing sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.\n                \nGiving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is critical to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats.\n                \nChecking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs.\n                \nTreatment for Patent Ductus Arteriosus\n                \nPDA is a possible complication of RDS. In this condition, a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus doesn't close after birth as it should.\n                \nThe ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery. If it remains open, it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries.\n                \nPDA is treated with medicines, catheter procedures, and surgery.
