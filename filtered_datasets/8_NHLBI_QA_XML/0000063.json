        "question": "What is (are) Heart Palpitations ?",
        "answer": "Palpitations (pal-pi-TA-shuns) are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast. You may have these feelings in your chest, throat, or neck. They can occur during activity or even when you're sitting still or lying down.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMany things can trigger palpitations, including:\n                \nStrong emotions\n                \nVigorous physical activity\n                \nMedicines such as diet pills and decongestants\n                \nCaffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs\n                \nCertain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease or anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)\n                \nThese factors can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual, or they can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. In these situations, the heart is still working normally. Thus, these palpitations usually are harmless.\n                \nSome palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nSome arrhythmias are signs of heart conditions, such as heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease. However, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias.\n                \nYou can take steps to reduce or prevent palpitations. Try to avoid things that trigger them (such as stress and stimulants) and treat related medical conditions.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPalpitations are very common. They usually aren't serious or harmful, but they can be bothersome. If you have them, your doctor can decide whether you need treatment or ongoing care.",

        "question": "What causes Heart Palpitations ?",
        "answer": "Many things can cause palpitations. You may have these feelings even when your heart is beating normally or somewhat faster than normal.\n                \nMost palpitations are harmless and often go away on their own. However, some palpitations are signs of a heart problem. Sometimes the cause of palpitations can't be found.\n                \nIf you start having palpitations, see your doctor to have them checked.\n                \nCauses Not Related to Heart Problems\n                \nStrong Emotions\n                \nYou may feel your heart pounding or racing during anxiety, fear, or stress. You also may have these feelings if you're having a panic attack.\n                \nVigorous Physical Activity\n                \nIntense activity can make your heart feel like its beating too hard or too fast, even though it's working normally. Intense activity also can cause occasional premature (extra) heartbeats.\n                \nMedical Conditions\n                \nSome medical conditions can cause palpitations. These conditions can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. They also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats.\n                \nExamples of these medical conditions include:\n                \nAn overactive thyroid\n                \nA low blood sugar level\n                \nAnemia\n                \nSome types of low blood pressure\n                \nFever\n                \nDehydration (not enough fluid in the body)\n                \nHormonal Changes\n                \nThe hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy, menstruation, and the perimenopausal period may cause palpitations. The palpitations will likely improve or go away as these conditions go away or change.\n                \nSome palpitations that occur during pregnancy may be due to anemia.\n                \nMedicines and Stimulants\n                \nMany medicines can trigger palpitations because they can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. Medicines also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats.\n                \nExamples of these medicines include:\n                \nInhaled asthma medicines.\n                \nMedicines to treat an underactive thyroid. Taking too much of these medicines can cause an overactive thyroid and lead to palpitations.\n                \nMedicines to prevent arrhythmias. Medicines used to treat irregular heart rhythms can sometimes cause other irregular heart rhythms.\n                \nOver-the-counter medicines that act as stimulants also may cause palpitations. These include decongestants (found in cough and cold medicines) and some herbal and nutritional supplements.\n                \nCaffeine, nicotine (found in tobacco), alcohol, and illegal drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines) also can cause palpitations.\n                \nCauses Related to Heart Problems\n                \nSome palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. However, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias.\n                \nDuring an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. An arrhythmia happens if some part of the heart's electrical system doesn't work as it should.\n                \nPalpitations are more likely to be related to an arrhythmia if you:\n                \nHave had a heart attack or are at risk for one.\n                \nHave coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk factors for CHD.\n                \nHave other heart problems, such as heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease.\n                \nHave abnormal electrolyte levels. Electrolytes are minerals, such as potassium and sodium, found in blood and body fluids. They're vital for normal health and functioning of the body.",

        "question": "How to diagnose Heart Palpitations ?",
        "answer": "First, your doctor will want to find out whether your palpitations are harmless or related to a heart problem. He or she will ask about your symptoms and medical history, do a physical exam, and recommend several basic tests.\n                \nThis information may point to a heart problem as the cause of your palpitations. If so, your doctor may recommend more tests. These tests will help show what the problem is, so your doctor can decide how to treat it.\n                \nThe cause of palpitations may be hard to diagnose, especially if symptoms don't occur regularly.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nSeveral types of doctors may work with you to diagnose and treat your palpitations. These include a:\n                \nPrimary care doctor\n                \nCardiologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions)\n                \nElectrophysiologist (a cardiologist who specializes in the heart's electrical system)\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask questions about your palpitations, such as:\n                \nWhen did they begin?\n                \nHow long do they last?\n                \nHow often do they occur?\n                \nDo they start and stop suddenly?\n                \nDoes your heartbeat feel steady or irregular during the palpitations?\n                \nDo other symptoms occur with the palpitations?\n                \nDo your palpitations have a pattern? For example, do they occur when you exercise or drink coffee? Do they happen at a certain time of day?\n                \nYour doctor also may ask about your use of caffeine, alcohol, supplements, and illegal drugs.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will take your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is normal. He or she also will use a stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat.\n                \nYour doctor may look for signs of conditions that can cause palpitations, such as an overactive thyroid.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nOften, the first test that's done is an EKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test records your heart's electrical activity.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart.\n                \nEven if your EKG results are normal, you may still have a medical condition that's causing palpitations. If your doctor suspects this is the case, you may have blood tests to gather more information about your heart's structure, function, and electrical system.\n                \nHolter or Event Monitor\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect heart rhythm problems that don't happen during the test. To diagnose problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a Holter or event monitor.\n                \nA Holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck.\n                \nDuring the 24- or 48-hour period, you do your usual daily activities. You use a notebook to record any symptoms you have and the time they occur. You then return both the recorder and the notebook to your doctor to read the results. Your doctor can see how your heart was beating at the time you had symptoms.\n                \nAn event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.\n                \nFor many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.\n                \nYou can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.\n                \nHolter or Event Monitor\n                \n\n                \nEchocardiography\n                \nEchocardiography uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.\n                \nThe test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.\n                \nStress Test\n                \nSome heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.",
