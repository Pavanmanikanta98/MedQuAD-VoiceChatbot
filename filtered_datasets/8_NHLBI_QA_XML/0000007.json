        "question": "What is (are) ARDS ?",
        "answer": "ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can be life threatening because your body's organs need oxygen-rich blood to work well.\n                \nPeople who develop ARDS often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. They might already be in the hospital when they develop ARDS.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand ARDS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).\n                \nSmall blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. Oxygen passes from the air sacs into the capillaries and then into the bloodstream. Blood carries the oxygen to all parts of the body, including the body's organs.\n                \nIn ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause fluid to build up in the air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.\n                \nAs a result, the body's organs (such as the kidneys and brain) don't get the oxygen they need. Without oxygen, the organs may not work well or at all.\n                \nPeople who develop ARDS often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.\n                \nIf you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nMore people are surviving ARDS now than in the past. One likely reason for this is that treatment and care for the condition have improved. Survival rates for ARDS vary depending on age, the underlying cause of ARDS, associated illnesses, and other factors.\n                \nSome people who survive recover completely. Others may have lasting damage to their lungs and other health problems.\n                \nResearchers continue to look for new and better ways to treat ARDS.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of ARDS ?",
        "answer": "The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and a low blood oxygen level.\n                \nOther signs and symptoms depend on the cause of ARDS. They may occur before ARDS develops. For example, if pneumonia is causing ARDS, you may have a cough and fever before you feel short of breath.\n                \nSometimes people who have ARDS develop signs and symptoms such as low blood pressure, confusion, and extreme tiredness. This may mean that the body's organs, such as the kidneys and heart, aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nPeople who develop ARDS often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.\n                \nIf you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.\n                \nComplications From ARDS\n                \nIf you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are: \n                \nInfections. Being in the hospital and lying down for a long time can put you at risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also puts you at higher risk for infections.\n                \nA pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This is a condition in which air or gas collects in the space around the lungs. This can cause one or both lungs to collapse. The air pressure from a ventilator can cause this condition.\n                \nLung scarring. ARDS causes the lungs to become stiff (scarred). It also makes it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air. Being on a ventilator also can cause lung scarring.\n                \nBlood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in your body. A blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body is called a deep vein thrombosis. This type of blood clot can break off, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism.",

        "question": "How to diagnose ARDS ?",
        "answer": "Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ARDS. For a list of these conditions, go to \"Who Is at Risk for ARDS?\"\n                \nYour doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems, such as heart failure. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nARDS may cause abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds.\n                \nHe or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body. Extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems.\n                \nYour doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips. A bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen. This is a possible sign of ARDS.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou may have ARDS or another condition that causes similar symptoms. To find out, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.\n                \nInitial Tests\n                \nThe first tests done are:\n                \nAn arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. A low blood oxygen level might be a sign of ARDS.\n                \nChest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether you have extra fluid in your lungs.\n                \nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count, blood chemistries, and blood cultures. These tests help find the cause of ARDS, such as an infection.\n                \nA sputum culture. This test is used to study the spit you've coughed up from your lungs. A sputum culture can help find the cause of an infection.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests used to diagnose ARDS include:\n                \nChest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or chest CT scan. This test uses a computer to create detailed pictures of your lungs. A chest CT scan may show lung problems, such as fluid in the lungs, signs of pneumonia, or a tumor.\n                \nHeart tests that look for signs of heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This condition can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for ARDS ?",
        "answer": "ARDS is treated in a hospital's intensive care unit. Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.\n                \nOxygen Therapy\n                \nOne of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.\n                \nOxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a breathing tube. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.\n                \nBefore inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.\n                \nThe breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.\n                \nYour doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.\n                \nYou'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).\n                \nThis procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.\n                \nSupportive Care\n                \nSupportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:\n                \nMedicines to help you relax, relieve discomfort, and treat pain.\n                \nOngoing monitoring of heart and lung function (including blood pressure and gas exchange).\n                \nNutritional support. People who have ARDS often suffer from malnutrition. Thus, extra nutrition may be given through a feeding tube.\n                \nTreatment for infections. People who have ARDS are at higher risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also increases the risk of infections. Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other infections.\n                \nPrevention of blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of your body. These clots can travel to your lungs and block blood flow (a condition called pulmonary embolism). Blood-thinning medicines and other treatments, such as compression stocking (stockings that create gentle pressure up the leg), are used to prevent blood clots.\n                \nPrevention of intestinal bleeding. People who receive long-term support from a ventilator are at increased risk of bleeding in the intestines. Medicines can reduce this risk.\n                \nFluids. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow through your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. Fluids usually are given through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels.",
