        "question": "What is (are) Fanconi Anemia ?",
        "answer": "Fanconi anemia (fan-KO-nee uh-NEE-me-uh), or FA, is a rare, inherited blood disorder that leads to bone marrow failure. The disorder also is called Fanconis anemia.\n                \nFA prevents your bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for your body to work normally. FA also can cause your bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer).\n                \nAlthough FA is a blood disorder, it also can affect many of your body's organs, tissues, and systems. Children who inherit FA are at higher risk of being born with birth defects. FA also increases the risk of some cancers and other serious health problems.\n                \nFA is different from Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi syndrome affects the kidneys. It's a rare and serious condition that mostly affects children.\n                \nChildren who have Fanconi syndrome pass large amounts of key nutrients and chemicals through their urine. These children may have serious health and developmental problems.\n                \nBone Marrow and Blood\n                \nBone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the large bones of your body. Healthy bone marrow contains stem cells that develop into the three types of blood cells that the body needs:\n                \nRed blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled.\n                \nWhite blood cells, which help fight infections.\n                \nPlatelets (PLATE-lets), which help your blood clot.\n                \nIt's normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than 1 day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells.\n                \nIf your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells to replace the ones that die, serious health problems can occur.\n                \nFanconi Anemia and Your Body\n                \nFA is one of many types of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nFA is a type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells. Low levels of the three types of blood cells can harm many of the body's organs, tissues, and systems.\n                \nWith too few red blood cells, your body's tissues won't get enough oxygen to work well. With too few white blood cells, your body may have problems fighting infections. This can make you sick more often and make infections worse. With too few platelets, your blood cant clot normally. As a result, you may have bleeding problems.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPeople who have FA have a greater risk than other people for some cancers. About 10percent of people who have FA develop leukemia.\n                \nPeople who have FA and survive to adulthood are much more likely than others to develop cancerous solid tumors.\n                \nThe risk of solid tumors increases with age in people who have FA. These tumors can develop in the mouth, tongue, throat, or esophagus (eh-SOF-ah-gus). (The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.)\n                \nWomen who have FA are at much greater risk than other women of developing tumors in the reproductive organs.\n                \nFA is an unpredictable disease. The average lifespan for people who have FA is between 20 and 30 years. The most common causes of death related to FA are bone marrow failure, leukemia, and solid tumors.\n                \nAdvances in care and treatment have improved the chances of surviving longer with FA. Blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the major advance in treatment. However, even with this treatment, the risk of some cancers is greater in people who have FA.",

        "answer": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease. The term inherited means that the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs when both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child.\n                \nPeople who have only one faulty FA gene are FA \"carriers.\" Carriers don't have FA, but they can pass the faulty gene to their children.\n                \nIf both of your parents have a faulty FA gene, you have:\n                \nA 25 percent chance of having FA\n                \nA 25 percent chance of not having FA\n                \nA 50 percent chance of being an FA carrier and passing the gene to any children you have\n                \nIf only one of your parents has a faulty FA gene, you won't have the disorder. However, you have a 50 percent chance of being an FA carrier and passing the gene to any children you have.",

        "question": "Who is at risk for Fanconi Anemia? ?",
        "answer": "Fanconi anemia (FA) occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects men and women equally.\n                \nIn the United States, about 1 out of every 181 people is an FA carrier. This carrier rate leads to about 1 in 130,000 people being born with FA.\n                \nTwo ethnic groups, Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners, are more likely than other groups to have FA or be FA carriers.\n                \nAshkenazi Jews are people who are descended from the Jewish population of Eastern Europe. Afrikaners are White natives of South Africa who speak a language called Afrikaans. This ethnic group is descended from early Dutch, French, and German settlers.\n                \nIn the United States, 1 out of 90 Ashkenazi Jews is an FA carrier, and 1 out of 30,000 is born with FA.\n                \nMajor Risk Factors\n                \nFA is an inherited diseasethat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs if both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child.\n                \nChildren born into families with histories of FA are at risk of inheriting the disorder. Children whose mothers and fathers both have family histories of FA are at even greater risk. A family history of FA means that it's possible that a parent carries a faulty gene associated with the disorder.\n                \nChildren whose parents both carry the same faulty gene are at greatest risk of inheriting FA. Even if these children aren't born with FA, they're still at risk of being FA carriers.\n                \nChildren who have only one parent who carries a faulty FA gene also are at risk of being carriers. However, they're not at risk of having FA.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Fanconi Anemia ?",
        "answer": "Major Signs and Symptoms\n                \nYour doctor may suspect you or your child has Fanconi anemia (FA) if you have signs and symptoms of:\n                \nAnemia\n                \nBone marrow failure\n                \nBirth defects\n                \nDevelopmental or eating problems\n                \nFA is an inherited disorderthat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. If a child has FA, his or her brothers and sisters also should be tested for the disorder.\n                \nAnemia\n                \nThe most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts. If you have anemia, you may not have the energy to do normal activities.\n                \nA low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, and chest pain.\n                \nBone Marrow Failure\n                \nWhen your bone marrow fails, it can't make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can cause many problems that have various signs and symptoms.\n                \nWith too few red blood cells, you can develop anemia. In FA, the size of your red blood cells also can be much larger than normal. This makes it harder for the cells to work well.\n                \nWith too few white blood cells, you're at risk for infections. Infections also may last longer and be more serious than normal.\n                \nWith too few platelets, you may bleed and bruise easily, suffer from internal bleeding, or have petechiae (pe-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae are tiny red or purple spots on the skin. Bleeding in small blood vessels just below your skin causes these spots.\n                \nIn some people who have FA, the bone marrow makes a lot of harmful, immature white blood cells called blasts. Blasts don't work like normal blood cells. As they build up, they prevent the bone marrow from making enough normal blood cells.\n                \nA large number of blasts in the bone marrow can lead to a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n                \nBirth Defects\n                \nMany birth defects can be signs of FA. These include:\n                \nBone or skeletal defects. FA can cause missing, oddly shaped, or three or more thumbs. Arm bones, hips, legs, hands, and toes may not form fully or normally. People who have FA may have a curved spine, a condition called scoliosis (sco-le-O-sis).\n                \nEye and ear defects. The eyes, eyelids, and ears may not have a normal shape. Children who have FA also might be born deaf.\n                \nSkin discoloration. This includes coffee-colored areas or odd-looking patches of lighter skin.\n                \nKidney problems. A child who has FA might be born with a missing kidney or kidneys that aren't shaped normally.\n                \nCongenital heart defects. The most common congenital heart defect linked to FA is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). A VSD is a hole or defect in the lower part of the wall that separates the hearts left and right chambers.\n                \nDevelopmental Problems\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of FA are related to physical and mental development. They include:\n                \nLow birth weight\n                \nPoor appetite\n                \nDelayed growth\n                \nBelow-average height\n                \nSmall head size\n                \nMental retardation or learning disabilities\n                \nSigns and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia in Adults\n                \nSome signs and symptoms of FA may develop as you or your child gets older. Women who have FA may have some or all of the following:\n                \nSex organs that are less developed than normal\n                \nMenstruating later than women who don't have FA\n                \nStarting menopause earlier than women who don't have FA\n                \nProblems getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to full term\n                \nMen who have FA may have sex organs that are less developed than normal. They also may be less fertile than men who don't have the disease.",

        "question": "How to diagnose Fanconi Anemia ?",
        "answer": "People who have Fanconi anemia (FA) are born with the disorder. They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth. For this reason, FA isn't always diagnosed when a person is born. In fact, most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years.\n                \nThe tests used to diagnose FA depend on a person's age and symptoms. In all cases, medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing FA. However, because FA has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases, only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nA geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes.\n                \nGeneticists do genetic testing for FA. They also can provide counseling about how FA is inherited and the types of prenatal (before birth) testing used to diagnose it.\n                \nAn obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to FA before your child is born. An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women.\n                \nAfter your child is born, a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has FA. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens.\n                \nA hematologist (blood disease specialist) also may help diagnose FA.\n                \nFamily and Medical Histories\n                \nFA is an inherited disease. Some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of FA, even if they don't have the disease.\n                \nOther parents, especially if they're FA carriers, may not be aware of a family history of FA. Many parents may not know that FA can be passed from parents to children.\n                \nKnowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has FA or another condition with similar symptoms.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you, your siblings, or your children have FA, he or she may ask you detailed questions about:\n                \nAny personal or family history of anemia\n                \nAny surgeries youve had related to the digestive system\n                \nAny personal or family history of immune disorders\n                \nYour appetite, eating habits, and any medicines you take\n                \nIf you know your family has a history of FA, or if your answers to your doctor's questions suggest a possible diagnosis of FA, your doctor will recommend further testing.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests and Procedures\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of FA aren't unique to the disease. They're also linked to many other diseases and conditions, such as aplastic anemia. For this reason, genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of FA. Genetic tests for FA include the following.\n                \nChromosome Breakage Test\n                \nThis is the most common test for FA. It's available only in special laboratories (labs). It shows whether your chromosomes (long chains of genes) break more easily than normal.\n                \nSkin cells sometimes are used for the test. Usually, though, a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle. A technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals.\n                \nIf you have FA, the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA.\n                \nCytometric Flow Analysis\n                \nCytometric flow analysis, or CFA, is done in a lab. This test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide. Skin cells are used for this test.\n                \nA technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally. If you have FA, your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals.\n                \nThe chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA.\n                \nMutation Screening\n                \nA mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes. Geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes, usually using a sample of your skin cells. With special equipment and lab processes, they can look for gene mutations that are linked to FA.\n                \nDiagnosing Different Age Groups\n                \nBefore Birth (Prenatal)\n                \nIf your family has a history of FA and you get pregnant, your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for FA.\n                \nTwo tests can be used to diagnose FA in a developing fetus: amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). Both tests are done in a doctor's office or hospital.\n                \nAmniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus. A technician tests chromosomes (chains of genes) from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with FA.\n                \nCVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta (the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother).\n                \nThe doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with FA.\n                \nAt Birth\n                \nThree out of four people who inherit FA are born with birth defects. If your baby is born with certain birth defects, your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FA.\n                \nFor more information about these defects, go to What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia?\n                \nChildhood and Later\n                \nSome people who have FA are not born with birth defects. Doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur. This usually happens within the first 10 years of life.\n                \nSigns of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with 7 to 8 years as the most common ages. However, 10 percent of children who have FA aren't diagnosed until after 16 years of age.\n                \nIf your bone marrow is failing, you may have signs of aplastic anemia. FA is one type of aplastic anemia.\n                \nIn aplastic anemia, your bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n                \nAplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals, radiation, or medicines.\n                \nDoctors diagnose aplastic anemia using:\n                \nFamily and medical histories and a physical exam.\n                \nA complete blood count (CBC) to check the number, size, and condition of your red blood cells. The CBC also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets.\n                \nA reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate.\n                \nBone marrow tests. For a bone marrow aspiration, a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells. For a bone marrow biopsy, a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells.\n                \nIf you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia, your doctor will want to find the cause. If your doctor suspects you have FA, he or she may recommend genetic testing.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Aplastic Anemia article.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for Fanconi Anemia ?",
        "answer": "Doctors decide how to treat Fanconi anemia (FA) based on a person's age and how well the person's bone marrow is making new blood cells.\n                \nGoals of Treatment\n                \nLong-term treatments for FA can:\n                \nCure the anemia. Damaged bone marrow cells are replaced with healthy ones that can make enough of all three types of blood cells on their own.\n                \nOr\n                \nTreat the symptoms without curing the cause. This is done using medicines and other substances that can help your body make more blood cells for a limited time.\n                \nScreening and Short-Term Treatment\n                \nEven if you or your child has FA, your bone marrow might still be able to make enough new blood cells. If so, your doctor might suggest frequent blood count checks so he or she can watch your condition.\n                \nYour doctor will probably want you to have bone marrow tests once a year. He or she also will screen you for any signs of cancer or tumors.\n                \nIf your blood counts begin to drop sharply and stay low, your bone marrow might be failing. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help your body fight infections. In the short term, he or she also may want to give you blood transfusions to increase your blood cell counts to normal levels.\n                \nHowever, long-term use of blood transfusions can reduce the chance that other treatments will work.\n                \nLong-Term Treatment\n                \nThe four main types of long-term treatment for FA are:\n                \nBlood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nAndrogen therapy\n                \nSynthetic growth factors\n                \nGene therapy\n                \nBlood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant\n                \nA blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the current standard treatment for patients who have FA that's causing major bone marrow failure. Healthy stem cells from another person, called a donor, are used to replace the faulty cells in your bone marrow.\n                \nIf you're going to receive stem cells from another person, your doctor will want to find a donor whose stem cells match yours as closely as possible.\n                \nStem cell transplants are most successful in younger people who:\n                \nHave few or no serious health problems\n                \nReceive stem cells from a brother or sister who is a good donor match \n                \nHave had few or no previous blood transfusions\n                \nDuring the transplant, you'll get donated stem cells in a procedure that's like a blood transfusion. Once the new stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\n                \nA successful stem cell transplant will allow your body to make enough of all three types of blood cells.\n                \nEven if you've had a stem cell transplant to treat FA, youre still at risk for some types of blood cancer and cancerous solid tumors. Your doctor will check your health regularly after the procedure.\n                \nFor more information about stem cell transplantsincluding finding a donor, having the procedure, and learning about the risksgo to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.\n                \nAndrogen Therapy\n                \nBefore improvements made stem cell transplants more effective, androgen therapy was the standard treatment for people who had FA. Androgens are man-made male hormones that can help your body make more blood cells for long periods.\n                \nAndrogens increase your red blood cell and platelet counts. They don't work as well at raising your white blood cell count.\n                \nUnlike a stem cell transplant, androgens don't allow your bone marrow to make enough of all three types of blood cells on its own. You may need ongoing treatment with androgens to control the effects of FA.\n                \nAlso, over time, androgens lose their ability to help your body make more blood cells, which means you'll need other treatments.\n                \nAndrogen therapy can have serious side effects, such as liver disease. This treatment also can't prevent you from developing leukemia (a type of blood cancer).\n                \nSynthetic Growth Factors\n                \nYour doctor may choose to treat your FA with growth factors. These are substances found in your body, but they also can be man-made.\n                \nGrowth factors help your body make more red and white blood cells. Growth factors that help your body make more platelets still are being studied.\n                \nMore research is needed on growth factor treatment for FA. Early results suggest that growth factors may have fewer and less serious side effects than androgens.\n                \nGene Therapy\n                \nResearchers are looking for ways to replace faulty FA genes with normal, healthy genes. They hope these genes will make proteins that can repair and protect your bone marrow cells. Early results of this therapy hold promise, but more research is needed.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nFA can cause birth defects that affect the arms, thumbs, hips, legs, and other parts of the body. Doctors may recommend surgery to repair some defects.\n                \nFor example, your child might be born with a ventricular septal defecta hole or defect in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. His or her doctor may recommend surgery to close the hole so the heart can work properly.\n                \nChildren who have FA also may need surgery to correct digestive system problems that can harm their nutrition, growth, and survival.\n                \nOne of the most common problems is an FA-related birth defect in which the trachea (windpipe), which carries air to the lungs, is connected to the esophagus, which carries food to the stomach.\n                \nThis can cause serious breathing, swallowing, and eating problems and can lead to lung infections. Surgery is needed to separate the two organs and allow normal eating and breathing.",

        "question": "How to prevent Fanconi Anemia ?",
        "answer": "ou can't prevent Fanconi anemia (FA) because it's an inherited disease. If a child gets two copies of the same faulty FA gene, he or she will have the disease.\n                \nIf you're at high risk for FA and are planning to have children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has FA. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you.\n                \nIf you're already pregnant, genetic testing can show whether your child has FA. For more information on genetic testing, go to \"How Is Fanconi Anemia Diagnosed?\"\n                \nIn the United States, Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of Eastern European descent) are at higher risk for FA than other ethnic groups. For Ashkenazi Jews, it's recommended that prospective parents get tested for FA-related gene mutations before getting pregnant.\n                \nPreventing Complications\n                \nIf you or your child has FA, you can prevent some health problems related to the disorder. Pneumonia, hepatitis, and chicken pox can occur more often and more severely in people who have FA compared with those who don't. Ask your doctor about vaccines for these conditions.\n                \nPeople who have FA also are at higher risk than other people for some cancers. These cancers include leukemia (a type of blood cancer), myelodysplastic syndrome (abnormal levels of all three types of blood cells), and liver cancer. Screening and early detection can help manage these life-threatening diseases.",
