        "question": "What is (are) Primary central nervous system lymphoma ?",
        "answer": "Primary central nervous system lymphoma (primary CNS lymphoma) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which cancerous cells develop in the lymph tissue of the brain and/or spinal cord. Because the eye is so close to the brain, primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye (called ocular lymphoma). The signs and symptoms vary based on which parts of the central nervous system are affected, but may include nausea and vomiting; seizures; headaches; arm or leg weakness; confusion; double vision and/or hearing loss. The exact underlying cause of primary CNS lymphoma is poorly understood; however, people with a weakened immune system (such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) or who have had an organ transplant appear to have an increased risk of developing the condition. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition and location of the cancerous cells.",
