        "answer": "X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5 (CMTX5) is a neurological condition characterized by peripheral neuropathy, early-onset bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss, and optic neuropathy leading to visual impairment. Peripheral neuropathy often begins with the lower extremities during childhood with foot drop and difficulty walking. Symptoms in the upper extremities are generally less severe and develop later. Intellect and life span are normal. CMTX5 is caused by a mutation in the PRPS1 gene. The condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. In rare cases, female carriers may exhibit mild symptoms. Standard guidelines for treatment of peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss and vision impairment should be followed.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5 ?",
        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Decreased nerve conduction velocity 90% Hearing impairment 90% Optic atrophy 90% Pes cavus 90% Impaired pain sensation 50% Gait disturbance 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Reduced consciousness/confusion 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Tremor 7.5% Areflexia of lower limbs - Childhood onset - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Motor delay - Onion bulb formation - Progressive visual loss - Segmental peripheral demyelination/remyelination - Sensorineural hearing impairment - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
