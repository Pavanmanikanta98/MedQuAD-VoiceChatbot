        "answer": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is an inherited connective tissue disorder that is caused by defects in a protein called collagen. Common signs and symptoms include hyperextensible skin that is fragile and bruises easily; joint hypermobility; severe hypotonia at birth; progressive kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis); and fragility of the sclera. EDS, kyphoscoliosis type is caused by changes (mutations) in the PLOD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms.",

        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type? The signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type vary but may include: Hyperextensible skin that is fragile and bruises easily Joint hypermobility that leads to frequent dislocations and subluxations (partial dislocations) Severe hypotonia at birth Progressive kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), present at birth or within the first year of life Scleral fragility Abnormal wound healing \"Marfanoid habitus\" which is characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly); unusually long limbs; and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum) Fragile arteries that are prone to rupture Delayed motor development Unusually small cornia Osteopenia (low bone density) Congenital clubfoot Cardiovascular abnormalities such as mitral valve prolapse or aortic root dilatation (enlargement of the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body) The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis 90% Abnormality of the mitral valve 90% Aortic dissection 90% Arterial dissection 90% Atypical scarring of skin 90% Gait disturbance 90% Joint dislocation 90% Joint hypermobility 90% Kyphosis 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Myopia 90% Scoliosis 90% Abnormality of coagulation 50% Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Decreased corneal thickness 50% Glaucoma 50% Hernia of the abdominal wall 50% Hyperextensible skin 50% Microcornea 50% Retinal detachment 50% Retinopathy 50% Subcutaneous hemorrhage 50% Visual impairment 50% Corneal dystrophy 7.5% Talipes 7.5% Arachnodactyly - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bladder diverticulum - Blindness - Blue sclerae - Bruising susceptibility - Congestive heart failure - Decreased fetal movement - Decreased pulmonary function - Dental crowding - Depressed nasal bridge - Disproportionate tall stature - Epicanthus - Gastrointestinal hemorrhage - Inguinal hernia - Joint laxity - Keratoconus - Molluscoid pseudotumors - Motor delay - Osteoporosis - Palmoplantar cutis laxa - Pes planus - Premature rupture of membranes - Progressive congenital scoliosis - Recurrent pneumonia - Respiratory insufficiency - Soft skin - Talipes equinovarus - Tall stature - Thin skin - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",

        "answer": "What causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is caused by changes (mutations) in the PLOD1 gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that helps process molecules which allow collagen to form stable interactions with one another. Collagen is a protein that provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Mutations in the PLOD1 gene lead to reduced levels of functional enzyme which disrupt networks of collagen throughout the body. This weakens the connective tissues and leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms associated with EDS, kyphoscoliosis type.",

        "answer": "Is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type inherited? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.",

A diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is typically based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms.

        "answer": "How might Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type be treated? The treatment of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliosis type is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving associated signs and symptoms. For example, physical therapy may be recommended in children with hypotonia and delayed motor development. This treatment can also help improve joint stability. Assistive devices such as braces may be necessary depending on the severity of joint instability. Depending on the severity of the kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), surgery may be necessary. Because EDS, kyphoscoliosis type is associated with fragile skin with abnormal wound healing, affected people, especially children, may need to wear protective bandages or pads over exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead. Regular follow-up may be recommended to check for development or progression of abnormalities of the eyes, cardiovascular system, and other parts of the body.
