        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Brachydactyly type A1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Brachydactyly type A1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Short hallux 90% Short stature 90% Cone-shaped epiphysis 50% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 7.5% Abnormality of the ulna 7.5% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Symphalangism affecting the phalanges of the hand 7.5% Talipes 7.5% Absent distal interphalangeal creases - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Broad metacarpal epiphyses - Broad palm - Distal symphalangism (hands) - Flattened metatarsal heads - Heterogeneous - Proportionate shortening of all digits - Radial deviation of the 2nd finger - Radial deviation of the 3rd finger - Radial deviation of the 4th finger - Short distal phalanx of finger - Short metacarpal - Short palm - Short proximal phalanx of hallux - Short proximal phalanx of thumb - Slender metacarpals - Thin proximal phalanges with broad epiphyses of the hand - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
