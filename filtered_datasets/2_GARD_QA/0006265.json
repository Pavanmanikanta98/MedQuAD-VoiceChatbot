        "answer": "Ulcerative proctitis is a type of ulcerative colitis that affects the rectum. The symptoms of this form of proctitis may include bleeding from the rectum, the need to go to the bathroom frequently, tenesmus, diarrhea or constipation, and rectal pain. People with ulcerative proctitis tend to have episodes when the symptoms worsen and periods without symptoms, although the course of the disease varies among affected individuals. Treatment involves applying 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) or steroid creams to the rectum. In some cases, an oral version of 5-ASA is used to prevent episodes.",
