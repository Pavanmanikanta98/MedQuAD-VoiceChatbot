        "question": "What is (are) Gamma heavy chain disease ?",
        "answer": "Gamma heavy chain disease is characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies. Antibodies are made up of light chains and heavy chains. In this disorder, the heavy chain of the gamma antibody (IgG) is overproduced by the body.  Gamma heavy chain disease mainly affects older adults and is similar to aggressive malignant (cancerous) lymphoma. However, some people with this disorder have no symptoms. People with symptoms may respond to chemotherapy drugs, corticosteroids, and radiation therapy. Approximately one-third of individuals with gamma heavy chain disease are also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.",
