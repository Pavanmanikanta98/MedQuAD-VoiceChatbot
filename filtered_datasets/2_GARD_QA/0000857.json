        "question": "What is (are) Brooke-Spiegler syndrome ?",
        "answer": "Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a condition characterized by multiple skin tumors that develop from structures associated with the skin, such as sweat glands and hair follicles. People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome may develop several types of tumors, including growths called spiradenomas, trichoepitheliomas, and cylindromas. The tumors associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are generally benign (noncancerous), but occasionally they may become malignant (cancerous). Individuals with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are also at increased risk of developing tumors in tissues in other areas, particularly benign or malignant tumors of the salivary or parotid glands and basal cell carcinomas. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is caused by mutations in the CYLD gene. Susceptibility to Brooke-Spiegler syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell increases the risk of developing this condition. However, a second, non-inherited mutation is required for development of skin appendage tumors in this disorder.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome ?",
        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Adult onset - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Milia - Neoplasm - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
