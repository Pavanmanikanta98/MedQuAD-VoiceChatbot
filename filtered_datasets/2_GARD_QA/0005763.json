        "answer": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13) is a rare sub-type of spinocerebellar ataxias, a group of neurological conditions characterized by degeneration of the brain and spinal cord. Signs and symptoms of SCA13 appear to vary among affected people and range from childhood-onset, slowly progressive gait ataxia and dysarthria (often with intellectual disability and occasional seizures) to adult-onset progressive ataxia. Life expectancy is normal. SCA13 is caused by mutations in the KCNC3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include anti-seizure medications; assistive devices (such as a canes and walkers); and/or speech therapy and communication devices.",

        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 13? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spinocerebellar ataxia 13. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal pyramidal signs - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Dysarthria - Gait ataxia - Hyperreflexia - Intellectual disability - Limb ataxia - Limb dysmetria - Morphological abnormality of the pyramidal tract - Motor delay - Muscular hypotonia - Nystagmus - Progressive cerebellar ataxia - Slow progression - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
