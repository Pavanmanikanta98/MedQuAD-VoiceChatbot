        "answer": "Congenital mirror movement disorder (CMM) is a rare condition that is characterized by mirror movements (involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements on the opposite side). Affected people generally develop these movements in infancy or early childhood, which usually persist throughout their life without any related signs or symptoms. In most cases, the involuntary movements are noticeable but less pronounced than the corresponding voluntary movements; however, the severity of symptoms can vary significantly, even among family members. CMM can be caused by changes (mutations) in the DCC or RAD51 genes and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In some families, the exact underlying cause of CMM is unknown.",

        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital mirror movement disorder? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Congenital mirror movement disorder. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Incomplete penetrance 50% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bimanual synkinesia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
