        "question": "What is (are) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ?",
        "answer": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nerves, the nerves running from outside the brain and spine. Defects in many different genes cause different forms of this disease. Common symptoms may include foot drop, foot deformity, loss of lower leg muscle, numbness in the foot or leg, slapping\" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking), and weakness of the hips, legs, or feet. There is currently no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, but physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other orthopedic devices, pain medication, and orthopedic surgery can help manage and improve symptoms. There are over 40 types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. You can search for more information on a particular type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease from the GARD Home page. Enter the name of the condition in the GARD search box, and then select the type from the drop down menu.",

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ?",
        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the pharynx 90% Abnormality of the voice 90% Decreased nerve conduction velocity 90% EMG abnormality 90% Gait disturbance 90% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% Impaired pain sensation 90% Incoordination 90% Kyphosis 90% Laryngomalacia 90% Scoliosis 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
