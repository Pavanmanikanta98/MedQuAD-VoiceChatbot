        "question": "What is (are) X-linked dominant scapuloperoneal myopathy ?",
        "answer": "X-linked scapuloperoneal myopathy is an inherited muscular dystrophy characterized by weakness and wasting of the muscles in the lower legs and the area of the shoulder blades. In some individuals, facial muscles may also be affected. While the progression varies from case to case, it tends to be relatively slow. Some cases of scapuloperoneal myopathy are caused by mutations in the FHL1 gene. These cases are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.",

        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of X-linked dominant scapuloperoneal myopathy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for X-linked dominant scapuloperoneal myopathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Adult onset - Arrhythmia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - EMG: myopathic abnormalities - Flexion contracture - Foot dorsiflexor weakness - Hyporeflexia - Lower limb muscle weakness - Myofibrillar myopathy - Scapular winging - Scapuloperoneal myopathy - Skeletal muscle atrophy - Slow progression - Steppage gait - Waddling gait - Weakness of facial musculature - X-linked dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
