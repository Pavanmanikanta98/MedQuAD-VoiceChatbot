        "answer": "Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare heart condition. In LVNC the inside wall of the heart is spongy or grooved, instead of smooth. Signs and symptoms of LVNC vary, but may cause life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms and weakness of the heart muscle. Treatments, such as blood thinning medication and defibrillators, are available to control these heart symptoms. In rare cases, heart transplantation is needed.",
