        "answer": "Glycogen storage disease type 13 (GSD13), also known as -enolase deficiency, is an inherited disease of the muscles.  The muscles of an affected individual are not able to produce enough energy to function properly, causing muscle weakness and pain.  GSD13 is caused by changes (mutations) in the ENO3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.",

        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Glycogen storage disease type 13? Glycogen storage disease type 13 causes muscle pain (myalgia).  Individuals with GSD13 also experience exercise intolerance, which means they have difficulty exercising because they may have muscle weakness and tire easily. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glycogen storage disease type 13. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Adult onset - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - Exercise intolerance - Increased muscle glycogen content - Myalgia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",

        "answer": "What causes glycogen storage disease type 13? Glycogen storage disease type 13 (GSD13) is caused by changes (mutations) in the ENO3 gene.  Glycogen is a substance that is stored in muscle tissue and is used as an important source of energy for the muscles during movement and exercise.  The ENO3 gene makes a chemical called enolase, which is an enzyme that helps the muscles use glycogen for energy.  In GSD13, the ENO3 genes do not work properly such that the body cannot make enolase, and as a result, the muscles do not have enough energy to work properly.",

        "answer": "How is glycogen storage disease type 13 diagnosed? Glycogen storage disease type 13 is diagnosed by taking a sample of muscle tissue (muscle biopsy) to determine if there is enough of the chemical enolase working in the muscle cells.  Genetic testing can also be done to look for changes (mutations) in the ENO3 gene.",
