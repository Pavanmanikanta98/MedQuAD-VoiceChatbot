        "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Brachydactyly type A6? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Brachydactyly type A6. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the vertebral column - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the middle phalanges of the hand - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bipartite calcaneus - Broad finger - Broad toe - Carpal synostosis - Decreased finger mobility - Dysplastic distal radial epiphyses - Fibular hypoplasia - Hypoplasia of the radius - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Mesomelia - Radial deviation of finger - Short phalanx of finger - Short stature - Short tibia - Short toe - Tarsal synostosis - Type A brachydactyly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",
