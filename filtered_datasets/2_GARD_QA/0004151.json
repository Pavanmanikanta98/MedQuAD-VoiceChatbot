        "question": "What is (are) Mucoepidermoid carcinoma ?",
        "answer": "Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of cancer of the salivary glands.  Salivary gland cancer is diagnosed in 2-3 individuals per 100,000 people each year, and 30-35% of these are mucoepidermoid carcinomas.   Mucoepidermoid carcinoma develops when a cell randomly acquires changes (mutations) in genes that regulate how the cell divides such that it begins to grow quickly, forming a cluster of cells (a mass or lump).  The earliest signs of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma may include a lump in the face, neck, or mouth; numbness, weakness, or pain in part of the face; or difficulty swallowing.  Treatment often begins with surgery to remove the entire tumor.  In some cases, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be used after surgery to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the body.",
