It is not a disease per se, but a condition caused by several disorders that affect a specific part of the autonomic nervous system, such as multiple system atrophy, young-onset Parkinsons disease, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, familial dysautonomia, and pure autonomic failure among others. The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that regulates certain involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder control.
